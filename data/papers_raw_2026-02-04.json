    "title": "Precise control of transcription condensates across S phase balances linker histone expression with DNA replication, ensuring genome stability.",
    "abstract": "Transcription condensates are liquid-like compartments where transcription factors, co-activators, and RNA polymerases are selectively enriched and regulate transcription initiation of associated genes. While the principles governing the enrichment of proteins within transcription condensates are being elucidated, mechanisms that coordinate condensate dynamics with other nuclear processes, such as DNA replication, have not been identified. We show in human cells that at the G1/S cell-cycle transition, large transcription condensates form at histone locus bodies (HLBs) in a cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and 2 (CDK1/2)-dependent manner. By mid-S phase, ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) accumulates within HLBs and dissolves the associated condensates via its downstream effector, CHK1. Failure to dissolve condensates results in overexpression of linker H1 histones and nucleus-wide DNA damage. Moreover, an imbalance in the different linker histones accentuates DNA damage in ATR-CHK1-deficient cells. Our work reveals how transcription condensates are precisely controlled in the S phase to fine-tune gene activation and safeguard genome stability.",

Here, we show that meningeal blood vessel blockage effectively suppresses glioblastoma (GBM) progression in murine models. Single-cell profiling of dura reveals a resident border-associated macrophage (rBAM) subset characterized by high neonatal Fc receptor expression, which endows rBAMs with superior capacity for presenting tumor antigens and activating CNS-patrolling T cells. Meningeal blood vessel blockage preserves dural cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-1 levels by restricting circulation-derived BAM (cBAM) and expands the rBAM pool, thereby enhancing T cell activation at the dura interface and amplifying intratumoral cytotoxic T cell responses. Clinically, rBAM abundance positively correlates with GBM patient survival. Our findings show that the dura is a critical regulator of anti-tumor immunity in CNS cancers and propose that meningeal blood vessel blockage may be a surgical strategy to potentiate GBM immunotherapy.",

Despite advances in rodents, a molecular marker for these mechano-insensitive C-fibers (CMis) in human skin remains elusive, preventing targeted therapy. Using a Patch-seq approach, we combined single-cell transcriptomics, following electrophysiological characterization, with single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics from pigs and integrated our findings with cross-species and human transcriptomic data. We functionally identified CMis in pig sensory neurons with patch clamp, using adapted protocols from human microneurography. We identified oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) and somatostatin (SST) as marker genes for CMis. Following dermal injection in healthy human volunteers, oncostatin M, the ligand of OSMR, exclusively modulates CMis. Our findings characterize the molecular architecture of human dermal sleeping nociceptors, providing a framework for mechanistic insight into neuropathic pain and potential therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Intratumor bacteria represent an understudied yet influential component of the cancer ecosystem, critically impinging cancer progression. In PyMT breast tumors, we find intracellular bacteria, when residing in cancer cell cytosol, promote metastasis by triggering cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) accumulation, which in turn activates the tumor intrinsic cGAS-STRING-interleukin (IL)-17B pathway and redirects neutrophils toward a protumor phenotype that inhibits cytotoxic T cells. By contrast, the same strain of bacteria, when present extracellularly, induces antitumor neutrophil activity without engaging the STRING pathway. Physiologically, eliminating intracellular bacteria, or therapeutically introducing extracellular bacteria components, abrogates immunosuppression and prevents postsurgical metastatic recurrence in preclinical models. Clinically, the bacteria invasion signature we have developed is associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. In summary, the spatial interplay between bacteria and host cells in metastatic niches can shape divergent tumor immunity, highlighting bacterial-host engagement as a crucial determinant of cancer immune regulation and a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids, produced by the plant under nutrient stress, are required to initiate the legume-rhizobia symbiosis through the activation of rhizobial nod genes. Notwithstanding the central role of flavonoids in nodulation, their transcriptional regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the nodulation signaling pathway 2 (NSP2) is required for transcriptional activation of flavonoid biosynthesis genes during nodulation in Medicago truncatula. Furthermore, MYB40, a legume-specific MYB transcription factor, is induced by rhizobia in the root epidermis. MYB40 directly binds to flavonoid biosynthetic gene promoters and is required for normal levels of nodulation. Biochemical and genetic evidence reveal that NSP2, not NSP1, interacts with MYB40 during rhizobial infection to strongly upregulate the symbiotic gene chalcone O-methyltransferase 1 in a manner dependent on MYB40 binding sites. Moreover, the overexpression of MYB40 and a microRNA-resistant NSP2 variant enhances nodulation under suboptimal rhizobial availability, suggesting this module fine-tunes symbiosis efficiency. Additionally, flavonoid regulation by NSP2 and MYB40 appears to facilitate arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization under nutrient starvation. Together, our findings establish an NSP2-MYB40 module that integrates symbiotic signaling with metabolic reprogramming, representing an evolutionary innovation for optimizing nitrogen acquisition in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Learning is vital for animal survival, but it must balance two conflicting demands: sensitivity (to avoid false negatives) and specificity (to avoid false positives). Improving one often worsens the other. Using Drosophila olfactory learning, we unravel how animals successfully perform both tasks. In Drosophila, odors are sparsely represented by cholinergic Kenyon cells (KCs). KCs form lateral axonal connections mediated by the muscarinic type-B receptor (mAChR-B), which suppresses non-specific learning. Using functional imaging, behavior, electrophysiology, and mathematical modeling, we show that mAChR-B is voltage dependent, switching between high- and low-activity states. In its high-activity state, it blocks plasticity in inactive KCs, whereas in its low-activity state, it permits plasticity in active KCs. This voltage-dependent switch enables differential neuromodulation, allowing learning to be both efficient and specific, minimizing both error types. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for precise neuromodulatory control, reshaping our understanding of neuronal communication.",

Current integration methods usually align multi-omics data into a shared latent space but fail to reveal the underlying connections between genes and regulatory elements. The correlation- or regression-based regulatory inference methods cannot dissect different transcriptional regulation codes for cells under different spatial and temporal states. To address both problems, we develop a feature-guided optimal transport (FGOT) method, which simultaneously uncovers cellular heterogeneity and their associated transcriptional regulatory links. FGOT also provides post hoc interpretability for existing integration methods. FGOT is applicable for paired/unpaired single-cell multi-omics data and paired spatial multi-omics data. Benchmarking and validating via histone modification data or three-dimensional (3D) genomics data show good robustness and accuracy in integration and inference of regulatory links. The method allows systematic screening of cell-state and spatial-location-specific regulatory elements in diseases at the single-cell level.

HS was derived through differential expression analyses and machine learning by integrating antibody sequences, gene expression, and affinity measurements of expressed antibodies. HS enabled sub-nanomolar-affinity antibody selection without prior sequence analysis in de novo immunization campaigns. HS-expressing B cells were 3 times more likely to yield high-affinity antibodies than randomly picked cells.

    "abstract": "The human brain stands out for the scale of cellular and morphological complexity across anterior-posterior domains. Modeling the entire neuraxis is therefore essential to comprehend human neural development and disease. Brain organoids commonly recapitulate anterior regions due to the propensity of neural progenitors to acquire telencephalic identities and self-organize into cortical layers. In the embryo, posterior brain patterning is orchestrated by organizers, signaling centers positioned at anterior-posterior locations that are rarely induced in vitro. Several strategies have been developed to reproduce organizer signals, employing small molecules and recombinant morphogens, thereby expanding the in vitro repertoire of human neural identities. Despite this, posterior models do not yet reproduce the morphological complexity of their in vivo counterparts. In this review, we discuss how this discrepancy may stem from the inability to recapitulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of organizer activity and how recent technologies can balance guided differentiation and self-organization, enhancing the fidelity of human brain organoid models.",

Exploring how glioma biology and therapeutic interventions influence immune recognition offers new opportunities to identify tumor-specific immune targets.\nWe performed immunopeptidomics on human cell line derived tumor tissue for DMG and glioblastoma (GBM) and defined how MTX-241F, a selective EGFR/PI3K inhibitor, changes the tumor immunopeptidome. Immunopeptides were isolated from xenografted tumors by capturing MHC-I bound peptides followed by mass spectrometry. Comparative analyses were performed across tumor type (DMG vs. GBM) and treatment condition (vehicle vs. MTX-241F).\nImmunopeptidomic profiling revealed tumor-specific differences in peptide repertoires between DMG and GBM. GBM tumors exhibited twice as many immunopeptides as DMG, which may be due to the distinct biology of each tumor type or may be indicative of potential HLA allotype composition. We identified highly abundant H2B1K-derived immunopeptides in DMG, suggesting that the H3K27M-driven epitranscriptome may promote turnover of other histones. MTX-241F increased the number of immunopeptides in DMG but reduced them in GBM, indicating a tumor-specific change in the immunopeptidome following EGFR/PI3K inhibition. In addition, we identified brain-enriched, HLA-A*02:01-binding and MTX-241F-exclusive immunopeptides that represent treatment-induced changes and may serve as biomarkers of therapeutic response or potential targets for CAR-T cell-based approaches.\nMTX-241F changes the glioma immunopeptidome, unveiling H2B1K, brain-enriched, and treatment-induced immunopeptides as immunologically visible targets. These findings provide a rationale for integrating molecularly targeted therapy with immunotherapeutic approaches to enhance tumor recognition and treatment efficacy in DMG and GBM.",

    "abstract": "PINK1-dependent activation of PRKN/parkin on depolarized mitochondria causes mitophagy. The deficiency of NME3, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase/NDPK on the outer mitochondria membrane (OMM), is associated with a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Here, we report that NME3 deficiency impairs p-S65-ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent PRKN binding on depolarized mitochondria without involving the loss of Ub phosphorylation by PINK1. Our mechanistic investigation revealed that NME3 interacts with PLD6/MitoPLD to generate phosphatidic acid (PA) from cardiolipin on the OMM of damaged mitochondria after depolarization. This lipid signal is essential for positioning MFN2 nearby PINK1 for phosphorylation of Ub conjugates on MFN2, thus enabling the subsequent amplification of PRKN binding to mitochondria. We provide further evidence that mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (Mito-ER) tethering prohibits the proximity of MFN2 with PINK1 and PRKN amplification on mitochondria. Importantly, the loss of NME3-regulated PA signal causes Mito-ER tethering. Overall, our findings suggest that NME3 cooperates with PLD6 to generate PA as a critical step in Mito-ER untethering, allowing MFN2 access to PINK1 for p-S65-poly-Ub-dependent feedforward activation of PRKN.",

    "abstract": "Doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapy drug, is produced by Streptomyces peucetius ATCC27952. The biosynthesis relies on the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase DoxA, which catalyzes three consecutive late-stage oxidation steps. However, conversion from daunorubicin to doxorubicin is inefficient, necessitating semi-synthetic industrial manufacturing. Here, we address key limitations in DoxA catalysis. We identify the natural redox partners ferredoxin Fdx4 and ferredoxin reductase FdR3 by transcriptomic analysis. We discovered the vicinal oxygen chelate family protein DnrV to prevent product inhibition by binding doxorubicin. Structural analysis of DoxA and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that inefficient C14 hydroxylation results from the unfavorable anti-conformation of the methyl ketone side chain of daunorubicin. We harness these advances for rational strain engineering, leading to an 180% increase in doxorubicin yields and an improved production profile. This study provides singular insights into enzymatic constraints in anthracycline biosynthesis and facilitates cost-effective manufacturing to meet the growing global demand for doxorubicin.",

Stigma exsertion is a critical trait affecting outcrossing rate. Here we characterize a rice mutant, high exsertion rate1 (her1), characterized by enlarged stigma and enhanced stigma exsertion. HER1 encodes a SET domain-containing protein that binds to histone H3 at methylated lysine 9 and regulates H3K9me2 levels. Loss of function of HER1 results in reduced H3K9me2 levels in her1, increasing the transcription of Downstream2 (DS2), which positively controls stigma size. Using the loss-of-function allele of her1, we develop a high-exsertion male-sterile line herA, which increases hybrid seed production by more than 20% in field conditions, substantiating the breeding value of HER1 in hybrid seed production.",

We saturation-edit twenty codons in the Trypanosoma brucei proteasome and subject the resulting libraries to stepwise drug selection and codon variant scoring, yielding dose-response profiles for >100 resistance-conferring mutants. Codon variant scores are predictive of relative resistance observed using a bespoke set of mutants, while fitness profiling reveals otherwise extensive constraints on mutational fitness and resistance space. The resistance profile is predictive of routes to spontaneous drug resistance observed within 'accessible', single nucleotide mutational space, while in silico predictions are closely aligned with impacts on drug resistance observed in cellulo. Thus, multiplex oligo targeting facilitates assessment of all possible mutations at a drug binding site.",

While primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (pcDLBCL-LT) is aggressive, primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma (pcFCL) and primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (pcMZL) typically follow an indolent course. To clarify their pathophysiological basis, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on pcFCL, pcMZL, and pcDLBCL-LT, alongside reactive B-cell rich lymphoid proliferations (rB-LP), gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and systemic counterparts. Here we show that the indolent pcMZL, pcFCL, and rB-LP exhibit a persistent germinal centre reaction, not observed in pcDLBCL-LT or gastric MALT lymphoma. Further, pcMZL top expanded clones develop within lesions from na\u00efve and not post-germinal centre B cells as currently presumed. Our data thus indicate that pcMZL and pcFCL, similar to rB-LP may be driven by (a yet unknown) antigen. While our data indicates that pcFCL exhibits some features of true lymphomas, it clearly supports the classification of pcMZL as a lymphoproliferative disease.",

Here, we develop two self-assembled molecules for perovskite surface modification and interfacial optimization with the hole transport layer. Through solvent engineering, ordered and uniform molecular packing is achieved on the perovskite surface. These molecules optimize surface energetics and promote efficient hole transfer when coupled with a homologous hole transport layer. Their large molecular dipoles tune interfacial energy alignment and reduce energetic offsets, thereby accelerating charge extraction from the perovskite layer. This dipole-driven interfacial modulation is effective in both normal and inverted device architectures. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 26.18% (certified 26.23%) is achieved in normal-structure devices, together with improved operational stability under maximum power point tracking. This work establishes a viable strategy for perovskite surface engineering using self-assembled molecules.",

Here we show a solvent- and binder-free method to fabricate sulfur-carbon composite electrodes directly on aluminum foil via thermal-assisted dry pressing. A key finding is the role of sulfur as a structural binder, where its softening, distribution, and adhesion properties enable the formation of mechanically robust electrodes without polymer binders. Systematic experimental characterizations and computational modeling reveal the underlying mechanisms governing electrodes formation and electrochemical performance. The developed binder-free positive electrodes achieve a reversible capacity of 932\u2009mAh\u2009g\u207b\u00b9 after 500 cycles at 1.0\u2009C rate; for comparison, conventional slurry-cast positive electrodes containing 10\u2009wt.% binder deliver lower capacity under the same electrochemical test conditions. This scalable process has the potential to reduce fabrication costs by a factor of 2.1 while eliminating hazardous solvents and binders, offering a sustainable and cost-effective approach to advancing Li\u2009|\u2009|S battery technology.",

The gut microbiome and metabolome are key regulators of cardiometabolic health and may mediate infection-associated effects on host physiology. Here we show that Schistosoma mansoni infection associates with distinct gut microbial and metabolic profiles linked to CVD risk in people living in Uganda. In a cross-sectional study of 209 individuals living in communities with contrasting S. mansoni endemicity, we profile the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the faecal metabolome using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. S. mansoni infection associates with increased gut microbial diversity and distinct taxonomic signatures, including enrichment of taxa such as Treponema and depletion of Prevotella and Streptococcus. Several infection-associated microbial taxa statistically mediate the relationships between S. mansoni infection and cardiovascular disease risk. Faecal metabolomic profiling identifies infection-associated metabolites, and integrative analyses showed linked microbe-metabolite networks associated with cardiovascular risk.These findings identify gut microbiome and metabolome signatures associated with S. mansoni infection and cardiovascular disease risk in Uganda. Although causality cannot be inferred, this work provides insight into host-parasite-microbiome interactions and highlights microbial and metabolic pathways relevant to cardiometabolic health.",

While scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) enables site-specific reactions by directly engaging individual atoms and bonds, conventional approaches rely on expert intervention and lack reproducibility and scalability. Here we introduce a deep learning-based strategy that autonomously executes multi-step, bond-selective transformations. Our system integrates computer vision for molecular recognition, neural networks for bond-state classification, and deep reinforcement learning for closed-loop optimization of activation parameters. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the selective dissociation of C-Br bonds in a tetra-brominated porphyrin on Au(111). Importantly, the approach extends beyond single-bond events, enabling programmed multi-step sequences including four distinct pathways with high fidelity. By advancing from isolated, human-directed manipulations to fully autonomous, data-driven reaction control, this platform establishes a paradigm for intelligent single-molecule chemistry. It provides a generalizable framework for on-surface synthesis, where adaptive agents orchestrate molecular transformations with a level of precision and scalability unattainable by manual approaches.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) comprising nearly 50% of the genome are generally silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic anti-cancer drugs can lead to their re-expression, however, the role of TEs in tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TEs and their activation of a viral mimicry response plays an important tumor suppressive role in inflammation. We discovered that both patients and mice with colitis express TEs that lead to a viral mimicry response. Interestingly, this response inhibits stemness of cancer-initiating cells. Further activation of viral mimicry by DNA hypomethylation inhibits tumorigenesis. Conversely, knockout of the anti-viral signaling protein MAVS promotes tumorigenesis and reverses the anti-tumor effect of DNA hypomethylation, confirming a tumor suppressive role of viral mimicry. Consistent with this finding, patients with colitis-associated dysplasia show decreased expression of TEs and interferon-related genes. These findings suggest that activation of viral mimicry inhibits stemness and plays a key tumor suppressive role in inflammation.",

Here we report a record-breaking emergence of an enhanced UDZC during the past two-to-three decades. In particular, the upstream-downstream covariance has increased from <10% to >60%, with the Eurasian upper-tropospheric westerly wind anomalies dominated by the Eurasian jet intensity change\u00a0mode, which prompts a large-scale interplay between Asian and Pacific subtropical highs and thereby induces mega-shifts in the distribution patterns of circulation and climate anomalies across Eurasia. Such large-range circulation adjustments are also accompanied by a circumglobal Silk Road teleconnection, a Rossby wavetrain with zonal wavenumber\u00a06, which originates from the\u00a0Northeast Atlantic and connects Asian climate with western Europe and North America heatwave and drought conditions. Climate model simulations suggest that the UDZC would further intensify as the northern mid-latitude warming becomes more pronounced.

However, its tethered configuration, invasiveness, and limited tissue compatibility motivate wireless, minimally invasive alternatives. Here, we develop an in situ-gelled injectable conductive hydrogel (ICH), enabling wireless neuromodulation via electric-field localization under volume conduction. The ICH forms in vivo through bio-catalyzed polymerization and electrostatic self-assembly, yielding a stable, highly conductive, tissue-soft, and biocompatible network. Under high-frequency capacitive coupling, impedance difference between the ICH and surrounding brain tissue induces interfacial polarization and charge accumulation, locally concentrating the electric field to activate nearby neurons. This mechanism is supported by enhanced calcium signaling, increased c-Fos expression, and electrophysiological evidence of balanced basal ganglia-cortical activity. In a Parkinson's disease rat model, ICH-mediated stimulation improved locomotor behavior, preserved dopaminergic neurons, and restored functional connectivity and structural integrity as revealed by fMRI. This injectable hydrogel bioelectronics provides a platform for minimally invasive, wireless neuromodulation therapies.",

PTTz-Cl50 exhibits ideal aggregation and optimal compatibility with BTP-eC9, enabling sequential deposition that forms a bicontinuous interpenetrating network with appropriate domain size and marked phase purity. This microstructure provides sufficient interfacial area for exciton dissociation while retaining high-purity charge transport pathways. Consequently, the device demonstrates rapid exciton dissociation, efficient charge transport, and suppressed recombination, enhancing both short-circuit current and fill factor. This yield a high power conversion efficiency of 20.42% for linear conjugated polymers, underscoring the promise of low-cost materials for efficient devices.",

    "abstract": "Hydrovoltaic technologies face challenges of low conversion efficiency and narrow operational temperature ranges, limiting their practical applications in extreme environments. Here, we propose a molecular clustering strategy that leverages organic molecules to interact with organic salt anions, forming stable composite clusters. These clusters enhance water's phase change energy barrier and thermal stability while mitigating electrostatic shielding effects, effectively overcoming ion transport bottlenecks across a wide temperature range. The hydrogel achieves an operational temperature range from -35\u2009\u00b0C to 80\u2009\u00b0C and increases power density by an order of magnitude compared to existing technologies. Furthermore, the hydrogel demonstrates exceptional thermal and mechanical stability, maintaining stretchability above 1000% and stable performance under harsh conditions such as freezing and high heat. These advancements enable hydrovoltaic systems to operate reliably in flexible electronics, environmental monitoring, and self-powered devices across extreme environments, providing sustainable energy solutions for diverse and demanding scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor nanocrystals with uniform morphology and composition are expected to show consistent responses during light-matter interactions. However, microscopy reveals significant variations in their photoluminescence blinking patterns, even under identical experimental conditions. This discrepancy arises from differences in crystal defects and nonradiative trap states. As a result, heterogeneous blinking patterns serve as valuable indicator of material quality, uncovering several concealed features through statistical analysis of large datasets. Nonetheless, efficient segregation and analysis of numerous blinking trajectories remain a challenge due to laborious calculations, computational bottlenecks, and manual intervention. In this study, we introduce a robust unsupervised machine learning (UML) assisted module to cluster high-dimensional blinking patterns in near-real-time, while calculating category-wise power spectral densities (PSD) to investigate active traps. Furthermore, we explore the impact of data preprocessing on clustering performance. The 'clustering-segregation-analysis' (UML-PSD) methodology demonstrates versatility, paving a way to advance contemporary (micro)spectroscopy, specifically for rapid and cost-effective optical characterization of semiconductor nanocrystals.",

    "abstract": "\u03b2-1,3-glucan synthase is the molecular target for triterpenoid and echinocandin antifungal drugs in clinical. It catalyzes the formation of \u03b2-1,3-glucan, which is the primary component of the fungal cell wall. However, the inhibition mechanism of \u03b2-1,3-glucan synthase by triterpenoid drugs remains unclear. In this study, we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae \u03b2-1,3-glucan synthase Fks1 and Fks2 in the apo state, the triterpenoid drug enfumafungin-bound state, and an open state. Structural analysis along with mutagenesis reveals the enfumafungin binding site, and the mechanism of the clinical drug-resistant mutations of the \u03b2-1,3-glucan synthases. Remarkably, the enfumafungin attaches on a single transmembrane helix TM5 of the \u03b2-1,3-glucan synthases, reorganizes its nearby lipid environment, and stabilizes the enzyme in a specific basal state with intact active site. Moreover, we elucidate that both the basal state and the open state are essential for FKS's glycosyltransferase activity. Our research also shows that Fks2 is highly conserved with Fks1 in terms of structure, activity, and drug inhibition. These findings provide deep insights into the fungal cell wall synthesis, and will facilitate the development of antifungal drugs targeting \u03b2-1,3-glucan synthase.",

One of the most mysterious one-shot learning abilities displayed by humans is one-shot perceptual learning, whereby a single viewing experience drastically alters visual perception in a long-lasting manner. Where in the brain one-shot perceptual learning occurs and what mechanisms support it remain enigmatic. Combining psychophysics, 7\u2009T fMRI, and intracranial recordings, we identify the\u00a0high-level visual cortex as the most likely neural substrate wherein neural plasticity supports one-shot perceptual learning. We further develop a deep neural network model incorporating top-down feedback into a vision transformer, which recapitulates and predicts human behavior. The prior knowledge learnt by this model is highly similar to the neural code in the human high-level visual cortex.

Novel structural-strengthening methods using ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composite (UHPFRC) have allowed the preservation of hundreds of bridges in several countries. Their service duration has been extended, and their performance has been improved to match that of a new structure. Examining the Swiss federal network (3903 bridges), it is found that interventions using the UHPFRC method are feasible on more than 99.7% of structures, demonstrating that the structural intervention can be technically applied to most bridges in this network. On the given case study, systematically applying the UHPFRC method would lead to savings of up to 7.7 MtCO",

Here, we present a strategy to improve recognition and lysis of tumors with suboptimal antigen expression through a separate engineered receptor that selectively boosts cytotoxic signaling and immune synapse formation. This synapse-stabilizing receptor (SSR) harbors a modified linker for activation of T cells (LAT) endodomain that amplifies CD3\u03b6 signaling upon binding to a secondary tumor antigen resulting in an augmented Ca2+ flux, activation of MAPK and NF-kB signaling, maturation of immune synapse, and enhanced T-cell degranulation. Removing C-terminal amino acids 178-233 in the LAT endodomain (LAT177) was necessary to minimize SSR-mediated cytotoxicity. In models of acute myeloid leukemia, we show that a CD38-targeting SSR boosts cytolysis of antigen-low cancer cells via a C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL1)-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and a survivin-specific T cell receptor (TCR). Unlike another CAR, SSR does not produce significant cytotoxicity against normal CD38+ tissues. Our study thus shows that SSR arming enhances targeting of antigenically heterogeneous cancers without compromising safety and selectivity of therapeutic T cells.",

This dynamic process requires AKIRIN2, a small unstructured protein whose mechanistic role has remained elusive despite its essential function. Using an integrated approach combining protein-wide saturation mutagenesis screens, cryo-EM, and biochemical reconstitution, we characterize AKIRIN2 as a scaffold protein that coordinates the assembly of an importin cluster around the proteasome. AKIRIN2 binds in multiple copies to the 20S proteasome and simultaneously interacts with importin IPO9 and the KPNA2/KPNB1 heterodimer. In the nucleus, RanGTP triggers importin dissociation, releasing the proteasome, while AKIRIN2 undergoes ubiquitin-independent degradation. Our findings reveal how AKIRIN2's multivalency facilitates the recruitment of multiple importins to the proteasome, a critical adaptation for transporting this large macromolecular complex into the nucleus and maintaining the nuclear proteome.",

As in mice, these waves in human fMRI are accompanied by phase-specific enhancements in sensory information encoding and memory retrieval.

To validate the designed energy streamlines, we perform optical tweezers experiments, treated as analogous to fluid particle-tracking velocimetry, demonstrating potential for high-precision optofluidic manipulation.

In HECs, multiple principal cations form solid solutions, similar to medium/high-entropy alloys (M/HEA). However, mixing of atoms can be non-ideal, resulting in chemical short-range order (CSRO). CSRO has been already reported in M/HEAs, cation-disordered oxides, and high-entropy oxides and in many cases, it was found to have significant impact on materials properties. CSRO in covalently-bonded high-entropy ceramics has not been observed so far, and its potential impact on materials properties is unknown. In contrast to M/HEAs, in HECs only one of the sublattices forms a solid solution, and therefore it is unclear whether the concept of CSRO extends to HECs. Here, we report the observation of CSRO in multiple HECs using a combination of atomistic simulations and scanning transmission electron microscopy. We find that CSRO in HECs can be controlled by both selection of chemical elements and heat treatment, and it significantly improves radiation resistance, although it is not the only factor.

Beyond its immune function on T cell surfaces, CTLA-4 is also expressed in various intrinsic cancer cells, where it influences cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis. The present study aimed to investigate the function of CTLA-4 in cancer cells by investigating the consequences of CTLA-4 depletion in melanoma cells. We found that targeting CTLA-4 in melanoma cells inhibited proliferation via the induction of senescence, which was attributed to genomic instability resulting from a decrease in Aurora B expression, leading to the activation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)-stimulator of interferon genes (STRING) pathway. Notably, DNA-PKcs coordinates CTLA-4 depletion-induced senescence by regulating the STRING pathway. Mouse study showed that the tumor suppressive effect of CTLA-4 depletion in allograft cancer models via senescence induction. Furthermore, public data analysis showed a negative correlation between CTLA-4 and DNA-PKcs expressions in patients. Conclusively, CTLA-4-depletion induces senescence via genome instability, which activates DNA-PKcs and ultimately leads to cancer growth regression. These findings suggest that intracellular CTLA-4 targeting can confer to cancer therapy.CTLA-4 depletion-induced senescence in cancer. CTLA-4 depletion-induced senescence in cancer. CTLA-4 deficiency induces senescence via the DNA PKcs-STRING-AKT pathway in cancer cells. When CTLA-4 is depleted in cancer cells, the genome becomes unstable due to the reduction of Aurora B expression, then consequently DNA damage occurs accompanied by micronuclei formation in the cytosol. Subsequently, DNA-PKcs is activated and sequentially promotes the STRING-AKT-p21 signaling pathway, which mediates cellular senescence and eventually prevents tumor growth.",

To overcome this weakness, we developed a miniaturized endoscope consisting of 128 iridium oxide recording sensors that allowed us to make high resolution intraluminal electrophysiological recordings in-vivo from the mucosal surface of the terminal large intestine of anesthetized mice. Recordings revealed discharges of smooth muscle action potentials organized into complex spatiotemporal patterns. The patterns were modified by pharmacological agents donepezil and atropine that stimulated or suppressed cholinergic neurotransmission, respectively. The patterns were also ablated by benzalkonium chloride, known to disrupt the function of the enteric nervous system. The endoscope was further validated under ex-vivo recording conditions, where blocking enteric neural activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) again altered spontaneously occurring action potential patterns. This approach offers a unique opportunity to easily characterize normal and dysfunctional patterns of GI electrical activity in genetically modified and/or diseased mouse models, including drug discovery and high-throughput studies.",

    "abstract": "Cancer signaling encompasses a wide array of entangled molecular cascades that promote oncogenic progression and counteract the effect of tumor suppressors. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) induces complex and stage-dependent effects throughout tumor progression. During pre-malignant hyperplastic growth, TGF\u03b2 restricts cell proliferation and inflammation, while on the other hand, TGF\u03b2 promotes migration and distal metastasis of cancer cells. To dissect the temporal chromatin-based transcriptional response to TGF\u03b2, we employed 3D culture models of isogenic human breast epithelial cells, exemplified by non-oncogenic MCF-10A (MI) and their HRAS-transformed counterpart (MII). Genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling revealed an extensive chromatin opening induced by TGF\u03b2 at transcription start sites and enhancer elements in both models, with a marked enrichment of SOX4 binding motifs in oncogenic cells. Transcriptomic analyses unexpectedly revealed the upregulation of DNA replication and DNA damage response pathways, following TGF\u03b2 stimulation of oncogenic MII 3D cultures. Canonical TGF\u03b2-driven programs, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metabolic reprogramming, were activated in both models. Notably, single-cell RNA-seq of primary breast tumors confirmed co-expression of SOX4 and cell cycle regulators. Mechanistically, we show that TGF\u03b2 induces the interaction between the MH2 domain of SMAD3 and the intrinsically disordered regions of SOX4, co-activating downstream gene targets. Validating the genome-wide analyses, we found that resistance of breast cancer cells to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib conferred by TGF\u03b2 stimulation was functionally dependent on SOX4. Collectively, our findings reveal an apparent oncogenic function of TGF\u03b2 in promoting cell cycle progression and drug resistance through SOX4, highlighting the pro-tumorigenic role of TGF\u03b2 signaling in breast cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Canonical nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) naturally store genetic information with high density and programmability, making them promising candidates for molecular data storage. However, their susceptibility to degradation under harsh conditions, such as extreme pH, nuclease activity, and chemical attack, limits practical applications. In contrast, non-canonical nucleic acids (ncNAs) with natural or synthetic structural modifications exhibit enhanced stability and unique functional potential. This review systematically summarizes the fundamental properties of ncNAs, evaluates their suitability for molecular data storage, and discusses how their distinctive advantages may overcome the intrinsic limitations of canonical nucleic acids while addressing challenges in next-generation storage systems.",

The study was conducted between April 2018 and December 2021 at five US tertiary-level pediatric cancer centers. All parents and children 5 years and older answered weekly child HRQOL and symptom surveys over 18 weeks (2-week run-in). Child-parent dyads were assigned (1:1) to PQ Response (n = 74) or usual care (n = 80) for 16 weeks. Primary outcomes were the difference between average 16-week and baseline Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL-4.0) total scores reported by parents and children (range, 0-100; higher = better HRQOL; minimal clinically important difference [MCID], 4.5). Secondary outcomes were PedsQL subscales and symptom scores. Analyses followed an intention-to-treat approach.\nOf 154 participants randomly assigned, 50% were girls, 78% were White, 17% were Hispanic, and 45% had brain tumors. The mean age was 11 years (standard deviation, 6.1). Parents assigned to PQ Response reported greater improvements in child HRQOL (PedsQL total mean difference 3.45 points [{95% CI, 0.48 to 6.43}; \nFindings suggest benefits of integrating electronic patient-reported outcome feedback and SPPC into pediatric advanced cancer care.

    "abstract": "Hypoxia signaling induced by VHL deficiency fuels growth but also imposes metabolic stress on clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Many ccRCC cells depend on glutamine as the primary source of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) anaplerosis. Hypoxia-inducible factor \u03b1 (HIF\u03b1) governs glycolysis but does not directly regulate glutamine metabolism; instead, the factor responsible for orchestrating glutamine metabolism and mitochondrial adaptations to hypoxia remains elusive. In this study, we showed that ZNF395 is a hypoxia-responsive factor that regulates glutamine metabolism in the mitochondria. When activated by a HIF2\u03b1-modulated superenhancer, ZNF395 facilitated the transcription of enzymes essential for glutaminolysis, including glutaminase (GLS) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2. Functionally, ZNF395 depletion resulted in reduced TCA cycle intermediates and their derivatives, including amino acids, glutathione, and pyrimidine nucleotides, leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration. Restoration of mitochondrial complex I function and GLS expression partially rescued the effects of ZNF395 depletion on ccRCC tumor growth. Together, this study underscores the coordinated role of HIF\u03b1 and ZNF395 in shaping metabolic adaptations in response to hypoxia in VHL-deficient ccRCCs.\nZNF395 and HIF are complementary mediators of hypoxia-induced metabolic reprogramming and therapeutic targets in VHL-deficient kidney cancer, with the former regulating glutamine metabolism and the latter regulating glucose metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Systemic administration of influenza virus-specific monoclonal antibodies achieves low concentrations in the nasal mucosa, the portal of infection. Intranasal administration may be more relevant for preventing infection, but the pharmacokinetics of intranasal influenza antibodies is unknown. We present results of preclinical studies and first-in-human phase 1 trials of the intranasally administered CR9114, an anti-hemagglutinin stem antibody that protects against influenza A and B viruses. We tested safety and tolerability of different schedules and doses; pharmacokinetics in nasal mucosal lining fluid of the nose and nasopharynx, saliva, and serum; and ex vivo functionality. We evaluated in vivo efficacy of CR9114 in mice and nonhuman primates. Intranasal CR9114 was safe and well tolerated across all doses and schedules. The half-life of CR9114 in the nose was ~3 hours. Steady-state concentrations were rapidly attained and sustained with multidosing. Through concentrations were up to 92-fold higher with twice-daily administration compared with once-daily administration. Pharmacokinetics of intranasal CR9114 in nonhuman primates mirrored that of humans better than mice. Postdose nasal samples potently bound hemagglutinin from diverse strains of influenza A and B viruses and, particularly at the 10-milligram dose, neutralized A/H1N1, A/H5N1, and A/H3N2 more potently than baseline samples. Twice-daily administration of CR9114 protected nonhuman primates against influenza virus challenge with the same intranasal formulation and device as used in humans, providing evidence for the efficacy of intranasal multidosing. Together, these study findings characterize the pharmacokinetics of CR9114 after intranasal administration and provide proof of concept that intranasal antibodies can elicit efficacious passive immunity against influenza viruses.",

The ~250-micrometer flexible guidewire incorporates a 460-nanometer luminescent core with an enhanced optoacoustic signature and a FePt magnetic tip for precise, steerable control. Proof-of-concept studies show that OptoMaG can be actively navigated with external magnetic fields to traverse a 3D human-scale cerebrovascular phantom and accurately reach target brain sites. Beyond navigation, the FePt tip enables localized thermal ablation under remote radiofrequency stimulation, highlighting its theranostic potential for tumor treatment. In addition, OptoMaG functions as a light source for photodynamic therapy, selectively activating photosensitizers to destroy tumor cells while preserving healthy tissue.

We find that racial disparities in suspensions increased, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing substantial shifts in Black populations. These increases were especially pronounced in suburban and rural areas with shifting Black populations and all predominantly White neighborhoods. Although school discipline reforms aimed to reduce racial disparities, they only declined in certain types of neighborhoods, most notably in urban areas.

To counteract NKG2A inhibitory signaling, we identified two specific fully human monoclonal anti-NKG2A antibodies that block HLA-E ligand binding. These antibodies activated NK cells and enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumor-targeting IgG1s both in vitro and in vivo. Bispecific engagers (BiNKs), generated by fusing NKG2A antibodies with tumor targeting binders, promoted immune synapse formation and directed cytotoxicity of NK and CD8",

    "abstract": "Brownian motion is a foundational physical process characterized by a mean squared displacement that scales linearly in time in thermal equilibrium, known as diffusion. At short times, the mean squared displacement becomes ballistic, scaling as [Formula: see text]. This effect was predicted by Einstein in 1907 and recently observed experimentally. We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of [Formula: see text]. This result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a nonzero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on nonzero initial velocities. These results are a step toward the unraveling of nonequilibrium dynamics of fluids.",

However, indefinite passaging of HuNoVs in HIEs remained a challenge, necessitating the use of patient stool samples as viral inocula. Using RNA-seq, we identified CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5 as up-regulated chemokines, suggesting their potential as host restriction factors. TAK-779, a CXCR3/CCR5/CCR2 antagonist, enhanced GII.3 HuNoV replication and viral spread in a dose- and time-dependent manner, enabling successful passaging of GII.3 HuNoV in two different HIE lines and generation of viral stocks. Sequencing passaged virus revealed one consensus change in the major capsid protein and several dynamic adaptations, suggesting emergence of variants. TAK-779 also enhanced replication of GI.1 and GII.17 strains, but not GII.4, suggesting strain-specific host interactions. This breakthrough in passaging provides insight into HuNoV-host interactions, establishes a scalable in vitro system for virus propagation, and opens avenues for structural, biochemical, and therapeutic studies.",

    "abstract": "Nervous system expansion relies on progenitor proliferation, yet its regional and evolutionary regulation is incompletely understood. While basally dividing progenitors are implicated in neocortical growth, their developmental origins and relevance beyond the cortex remain unclear. We show here that double inactivation of spindle orientation regulators GPSM2 and SAPCD2 in mice completely reorients progenitor divisions in both the neocortex and retina. This shift increases basal progenitors over sixfold in the neocortex and induces their ectopic emergence in the retina, resulting in extra cell layers and\u00a0~30% tissue enlargement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the induced basal progenitors in the cortex resemble human outer radial glia, and both cortical and retinal progenitors show altered Hippo signaling. Last, macaque and human retinas display twice as many reoriented divisions as the mouse and naturally contain basal progenitors. These findings show that division orientation is critical for regulating neural progenitor output and scaling tissue growth.",

Detachment has long been described as smooth drainage governed by a Reynolds-type pressure gradient. Combining spatiotemporal pressure mapping with confocal imaging of the fluid layer between a suction cup-substrate interface, we reveal a two-stage, nonequilibrium pathway for pressure equalization that challenges this conventional view. Suction-induced elastic deformation dynamically remodels the interfacial fluid, producing a self-coupled pressure channel system. Stage I is governed by an outward-moving invasion-percolation suction front with diffusion-like scaling. When internal suction falls below a critical value, the network opens globally, and stage II follows classical Poiseuille drainage. This mechanism defines a self-modifying percolation in which the flow remodels its own pathways, which advances our understanding of biological suction and viscous adhesion and suggests design principles for long-lived wet adhesives and hydrogel microfluidics.",

However, all the previous samples were from the lunar nearside and the radiometric ages of those samples that can be associated with particular surfaces are <4.0 billion years. On 25 June 2024, Chang'e-6 successfully returned 1.935-kilogram samples from the lunar farside. The samples included local basalts with an age of 2807\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 million years and the norites with an age of 4247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 million years likely corresponding to the age of the South Pole-Aitken basin. With these radiometric ages, we refined the lunar chronology function (CF) and verified that it is still consistent with a combination of an exponential decrease and a linear rate. We further derived the impacting rate and found it supports a smooth decay instead of abrupt changes of the impactor flux at early times. The refined lunar CF can be used to obtain more reliable ages for unsampled lunar areas and provide critical constraint for the lunar early impact history.",

However, the mechanisms by which electrical signals are generated, sensed, and transmitted upon damage to promote organ growth remain unclear. Here, we uncover that organ repair relies on dynamic electrochemical coupling between membrane potential depolarization and intracellular signaling, essential to activate cell proliferation. By subsecond live imaging of locally injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across time and space: a millisecond, long-range, membrane depolarization gradient, followed by second-persistent intracellular calcium responses. In the subsequent hour, voltage sensing phosphatase senses the injury-driven membrane potential change and autonomously translates the electric signal intracellularly, promoting tissue-wide cell proliferation. Connecting these dynamics with an electrodiffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin's interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading. Our work reveals the coupling between fast electrical signals and slower intracellular signaling, ensuring complete organ recovery.",

Here we incorporate realistic volcanic forcing into a large ensemble of glacial era-coupled atmosphere-ocean model simulations. These simulations are constrained by sulfate records from ice cores, which help estimate the timing of past major eruptions. We investigate how volcanic eruptions may have occasionally triggered abrupt climate change during the last glacial period. Our results show that very large equatorial eruptions can induce large changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation via atmospheric and ocean circulation changes and air-sea buoyancy fluxes, potentially pushing the climate system between persistent warm and cold states lasting millennia. A simplified perspective of the dynamics shows how unforced natural climate variability may exert a stabilizing influence decades after an eruption, especially as the system nears a tipping point.",

Fast-sinking marine snow particles, such as diatom aggregates, encounter a rapid increase in hydrostatic pressure during their descent. Using incubations in rotating pressure tanks, we found that pressure levels corresponding to 2- to 6-kilometer water depth induce leakage of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from diatom aggregates equivalent to ~50% of their initial carbon contents. The leaked DOM proved to be diatom-derived and changed the amount and composition of DOM in the surrounding seawater substantially. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, high protein-like fluorescence, and low carbon:nitrogen ratios classified the leaked DOM as labile. The bioavailability of leaked DOM was demonstrated by its rapid utilization by a pelagic microbial community, leaving mainly recalcitrant DOM behind. Pressure-induced DOM leakage likely weakens the gravitational \"biological carbon pump\" and supplies labile DOM to the pelagic microbiome of the deep ocean.",

Here, we identify a dual-functional ensemble within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that modulates both anxiety-like behaviors and insomnia through distinct neural circuits. Specifically, a subset of BNST neurons exhibits enhanced activity in response to anxiety-related cues and during wakefulness. Activation of these ensemble neurons exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors and reduces non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice. Conversely, inactivation of these neurons alleviates anxiety-like behaviors and promotes NREM sleep. In addition, anxiolytic-hypnotic medication attenuates BNST stress ensemble hyperactivity, mitigating both phenotypes. Furthermore, BNST stress ensembles project divergently to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the preoptic area (POA): DRN-projecting neurons selectively modulated anxiety, whereas POA-projecting neurons specifically regulated sleep-wake states. These findings suggest that hyperactive BNST stress ensembles are responsible for inducing anxiety-like behaviors and disrupting sleep in CRS mice and achieve the modality specificity through their divergent downstream targets.",

This technique uses converging near-infrared (NIR) lines scanned at multiple angles for tight optical excitation; a low-frequency, full-ring ultrasound transducer array for high-sensitivity detection; and a compound reconstruction algorithm integrating filtered back-projection and optical localization of photoacoustic signals to recover the image. We perform long-term (>5 months), noninvasive imaging of the entire cortex of mice through the intact scalp and skull with a field of view of 13 millimeters and a spatial resolution of 33 micrometers.

Accumulating evidence highlights the critical role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (calves), in mediating resistance to these treatments. TAMs and calves drive immune evasion, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness. Moreover, their crosstalk via signaling molecules such as osteopontin (SPP1) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) contributes to the formation of immunosuppressive niches and tumor immune barriers that impair therapeutic efficacy. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which TAMs and calves contribute to resistance to ICIs and TKIs and discusses therapeutic strategies under active investigation targeting these stromal components-including inhibition of TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, and HGF/MET pathways, TAM reprogramming via PI3K\u03b3 or CD47 blockade, and CALF depletion using FAP-targeted approaches. Targeting the TME holds promise for overcoming therapeutic resistance and improving clinical outcomes in advanced HCC, warranting further evaluation in well-designed clinical trials.",

Their functions are tightly controlled by regulatory circuits, often referred to as checkpoints, and are profoundly shaped by local environments. In cancer, tissue perturbations cause immune cell recruitment, spatial re-distribution, and accordant functional adaptations. Here, we discuss how tissue-specific cues regulate NK/ILC functions in cancer, and how local regulatory circuits shape their cellular states and effector programs. We address how targeting innate checkpoints could aid existing, and inform novel strategies for treating solid malignancies.",

This first-of-its-kind report encompasses progress against pediatric cancers made over the past decade and chronicles major developments in molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and genomic profiling that are reshaping pediatric cancer diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment. The report also underscores the enduring challenges that impede progress, including the lack of effective therapies for rarer and aggressive pediatric cancers and the persistent inequities in access to high-quality treatment and supportive care, both in the United States and worldwide. Collectively, these insights reaffirm the urgent need for increased federal investment, strengthened international collaboration, and innovative research strategies to accelerate progress against pediatric cancer.

    "abstract": "Plasticity is crucial for environmental adaptation in animals, yet its role in life cycle evolution remains poorly understood. Anurans exhibit a biphasic life cycle, with tadpole and frog following distinct evolutionary trajectories. The non-obligate cave-dwelling frog Oreolalax rhodostigmatus exemplifies this phenomenon: its tadpoles have well adapted to caves, while frogs depend on outside resources. Stage-dependent adaptive plasticity may explain this paradoxical life cycle, predicting that environmental responsiveness declines after metamorphic climax and that early-stage plasticity facilitates adaptations to resource-limited cave environments.\nWe examined transcriptional plasticity of O. rhodostigmatus by comparing cave- and outside-dwelling tadpoles from the same population across four organs (liver, tail, skin, and hindlimb) at ten developmental stages, spanning pre-metamorphosis to metamorphic climax. Organ transcriptomes reflected both developmental and environmental effects. As predicted, transcriptional responses to environmental conditions in the liver, skin, and tail declined markedly after the onset of metamorphic climax, while the frog-specific organ, hindlimb, showed the weakest environmental responsiveness. Prior to the metamorphic climax, cave-dwelling individuals showed upregulation of fundamental cellular processes (e.g., RNA and protein synthesis) while downregulation of immune-related processes, consistent with a resource-allocation strategy in resource-limited environments. Moreover, increased expression of genes involved in bile biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism in the liver suggests enhanced nutrient absorption and utilization, while upregulation of glucagon- and insulin-resistance-related genes in the tail indicates improved tolerance to starvation.\nOur findings support the hypothesis that stage-dependent plasticity explains the evolution of non-obligate cave-dwelling in anurans, highlighting the potential role of plasticity in shaping animal lifestyle evolution.",

    "abstract": "Human disturbances are modifying animal behavior in ecosystems worldwide, with the potential to reshape species interactions. For instance, human-induced shifts in diel activity may disrupt the alignment of daily activity patterns between interacting species and destabilize temporal niche partitioning. To test this hypothesis, we leverage a global meta-analysis on the effects of human disturbance on diel activity and overlap of 480 mammalian predator-prey and intraguild predator dyads from 57 studies. We demonstrate that human disturbance has no overall effect on temporal overlap. Instead, the body mass ratios between dominant species and subordinate species shape the influence of human disturbance. When subordinates are larger than dominant species, humans compress the temporal niche (i.e., higher diel overlap), but when dominant species are larger than subordinate species, humans expand the temporal niche (i.e., lower diel overlap). These results suggest that larger bodied mammals \"lose\" the temporal predator-prey response race under human disturbance, with large predators experiencing less overlap with their prey, and large prey facing more overlap with their predators. As the human footprint expands globally, we can expect continued alterations to the animal temporal niche, with consequences for species interactions, population persistence, community structure, and evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Fusion-positive myoepithelial tumors (MET) are clinicopathologically heterogeneous and variably termed mixed tumors and myoepithelial carcinomas. As FET-rearranged METs lack ductal/epithelial differentiation, we test whether FET-rearranged METs are epigenetically distinct from adnexal PLAG1-rearranged METs, which we hypothesize to be analogues of salivary gland METs.\nDNA methylation profiling from a multi-institutional cohort of 52 fusion-positive skin, soft-tissue, and bone MET cases was performed and compared with diverse tumor types, including salivary METs. The MET subgroups harbored EWSR1::KLF15, EWSR1/FUS::KLF17, EWSR1::PBX1, EWSR1::PBX3, EWSR1/FUS::POU5F1, SS18::POU5F1, EWSR1::ZNF444, and PLAG1 rearrangements. Pooled clinicopathologic and outcome analysis with new and published cases (total 185) was performed.\nThe MET subgroups showed significant heterogeneity in age, site, and histology. Specifically, EWSR1::KLF15 METs affected predominantly young children (<5 years); EWSR1::PBX1/PBX3 METs were enriched in skin/bone; and EWSR1/FUS::POU5F1, SS18::POU5F1, and EWSR1::KLF15 METs tended to display malignant histology. Conversely, PLAG1-rearranged tumors were predominantly benign, arising in older adults and located in the skin. DNA methylation profiling revealed that FET-rearranged METs were epigenetically related to SS18::POU5F1 METs and FET::NFATC2 sarcomas but entirely distinct from PLAG1-rearranged adnexal and salivary METs. Histologic features were correlated with the degree of genome-wide copy-number variation. The median disease-specific survival was shortest in SS18::POU5F1 (31 months), EWSR1::PBX3 (38 months), and EWSR1::KLF15 (45 months) METs. On multivariate analysis, age <25 years was a significant predictor of worse progression-free survival.\nFET-rearranged METs are epigenetically unrelated to cutaneous and salivary gland METs, and their malignant counterparts are best classified as sarcomas rather than carcinomas.",

In addition to faithfully recapitulating molecular and histologic features of the parental tumor, PDOs were sufficiently expanded for pharmacotyping within a clinically relevant time frame of 36 days. Notably, PDO chemotherapeutic sensitivity profiles correlated with patient serum CA 19-9 dynamics and recurrence-free survival. Furthermore, expanded \u03b3\u03b4-enriched TILs supported the activation of \u03b1\u03b2 TCR+ cells and demonstrated more potent functionality in response to autologous PDO targets.

The primary objective was determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of sapacitabine with olaparib. Archival samples were subjected to IHC for biomarkers of homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency and replication stress. Serial blood samples were collected for ctDNA analysis.\nTen patients (3 BRCA1 and 7 BRCA2) were enrolled. The RP2D was not determined due to hematologic toxicities. The objective response rate (ORR) was 50% (95% confidence interval, 18.7%-81.3%), with median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 9.7 months (95% confidence interval, 8.02-not estimable). Three patients had clinical benefit greater than 15 months, including two who remained on trial for more than 40 months. Tumors from responding patients demonstrated HRR deficiency and/or replication stress by IHC. At progression, ctDNA from two patients had evidence of BRCA reversion mutations associated with a microhomology-mediated end-joining signature, and three patients had acquired putative nonreversion mechanisms of resistance.\nSapacitabine with olaparib produces high rates of hematologic toxicity. However, the ORR of 50%, mPFS of 9.7 months, and durability of response in some patients suggest possible combinatorial benefit. Further exploration of olaparib with different sapacitabine schedules or substitution of a PARP1-selective inhibitor to potentially decrease hematologic toxicity is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer incidence and mortality are rising globally, largely driven by the obesity epidemic. Treatment options remain limited for obesity-associated, hormone-resistant, or fertility-preserving endometrial cancer, highlighting the need for novel therapies that address both tumor biology and metabolic dysfunction. In this study, we synthesize the molecular rationale, preclinical, population-based, and emerging clinical trial evidence on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists (GLP-1 RA) in endometrial cancer. GLP-1R is expressed in benign and malignant endometrial tissues, where activation of cAMP-PKA and AMPK-mTOR signaling has been shown to mediate antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and autophagy-inducing effects. Preclinical models demonstrate that class-wide GLP-1 RAs may restore progesterone receptor expression, overcome hormone resistance, and synergize with progestin therapy; however, the effects may vary by agent. Retrospective studies suggest that combining GLP-1 RAs with local progestin therapy, commonly a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (preferred in obesity because oral progestin bioavailability is reduced), is associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer in high-risk women. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing their role in fertility-sparing settings-evaluating complete response to progestin-based therapy, relapse rates, and time to conception outcomes-as well as in adjuvant settings, in which disease-free survival is a key endpoint; however, gastrointestinal tolerability and the absence of long-term safety data in endometrial cancer populations remain important considerations. As a class, GLP-1 RAs represent a promising therapeutic approach to targeting both the obesogenic milieu and tumor-intrinsic pathways in endometrial cancer; however, agent-specific differences warrant attention. Prospective, subtype-stratified trials are essential to establish their role in comprehensive endometrial cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used in the clinic can engage the immune system through their Fc domains, eliciting effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Although natural killer (NK) cells have historically been implicated as the principal mediators of ADCC, emerging evidence suggests that tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), particularly monocyte-derived subsets, play a central role in ADCP. These macrophages are abundant within the tumor microenvironment, express high levels of activating Fc \u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R), and retain robust phagocytic capacity. However, the heterogeneity of TAMs and the limited understanding of Fc\u03b3R expression patterns across tumor types have constrained the therapeutic exploitation of ADCP. This review critically examines the contribution of macrophage-mediated ADCP to the activity of both tumor-targeting and immunoregulatory mAbs. We discuss how Fc\u03b3R polymorphisms, isotype engineering, and antibody effector functions influence therapeutic efficacy, with particular attention to commonly used tumor targeting and immunomodulatory antibodies. The role of inhibitory receptors such as Fc\u03b3RIIb, CD47, and PD-1 in modulating ADCP is also addressed. Advances in multispecific antibodies targeting tumor antigens alongside ADCP regulators, and preclinical data highlighting the importance of Fc\u03b3R engagement, underscore the untapped potential of this pathway. We highlight key challenges, including TAM heterogeneity and macrophage hypophagia. Emerging strategies integrating synthetic biology and Fc\u03b3R profiling may enable the rational design of therapies that selectively enhance ADCP. Macrophage-mediated ADCP represents a promising but underexploited axis in cancer immunotherapy, warranting further mechanistic investigation and translational development.",

During the dose-selection phase, ipatasertib at 400 mg daily (21 days on and 7 days off) with standard HP was established as the recommended phase II dosage. This decision was based on the absence of dose-limiting toxicities in the first six patients treated at this dosage during the initial 28-day cycle, which constituted the primary endpoint. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) occurred in seven patients (41.2%), most commonly diarrhea and nausea. Two (11.8%) reported four serious TRAE (diarrhea, vomiting, ischemic stroke, and pneumonitis, one case each) related to ipatasertib, from which they recovered. The confirmed overall response rate was 31.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.1%-58.5%], clinical benefit rate 84.6% (95% CI, 53.7%-97.3%), and median progression-free survival 16.4 months (95% CI, 9.4-NR); 47.3% of patients were progression free at 18 months.\nThese results support ipatasertib plus HP as a safe and promising maintenance strategy for HER2-positive breast tumors harboring PIK3CAmut.",

It provides three scores: relapse risk, likelihood of pathologic complete response (pCR), and ERBB2 mRNA expression. This study aimed to evaluate the association between HER2DX and histopathologic features and assess its relationship with pCR after neoadjuvant therapy.\nPatients with newly diagnosed stage I to III HER2+ breast cancer were analyzed based on available HER2DX results during routine care in Spain (January 2022-June 2025). Centralized HER2DX testing was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Histopathologic analysis included tumor grade, hormone receptor status, histologic subtype, Ki67 index, HER2 IHC score, stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), tertiary lymphoid structures, and spatial immune distribution. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with pCR after neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy.\nA total of 410 HER2+ tumors were analyzed, and 250 patients received neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy with available surgical outcomes (36% achieved a pCR). HER2DX pCR scores were significantly associated with all eight histopathologic features, whereas relapse risk and ERBB2 scores were associated with five and two, respectively. TIL correlated with the immune/immunoglobulin signature (r = 0.59), and Ki67 with the proliferation signature (r = 0.50). The HER2DX pCR score remained the only independent predictor of pCR in multivariable analysis (OR, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.97; P = 0.030).\nHER2DX reflects key biological and pathologic features of HER2+ breast cancer and independently predicts pCR, supporting its utility for individualized treatment decision-making.",

In this study, we present the efficacy and safety results of a phase II trial evaluating tislelizumab combined with hypofractionated radiotherapy plus nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine (THAG) in patients with BRPC/LAPC (ChiCTR2000032955, NCT05634564).\nThis phase II trial enrolled 56 patients with BRPC/LAPC (BRPC: 17, 30.4%; LAPC: 39, 69.6%). Participants received tislelizumab plus nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine (AG) in 21-day cycles. Nonprogressing patients received concurrent radiotherapy during the third chemotherapy cycle. After four treatment cycles, a multidisciplinary team assessed eligibility for radical surgery. Dynamic biomolecular profiling was performed.\nFifty-six eligible patients were enrolled. The objective response rate was 51.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 38.0%-65.3%]. Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI, 11.6-19.4 months), and median overall survival (mOS) was 21.3 months [95% CI, 18.8-not reached (NR)]. Among 30 patients who met criteria for surgical resectability, 22 patients (22/56, 39.3%) underwent radical resection, comprising nine patients with BRPC (9/17, 52.9%) and 13 patients with LAPC (13/39, 33.3%). The margin-negative resection rate reached 90.9% (95% CI, 70.8%-98.9%), and the mOS of patients who underwent surgery was 34.0 months (95% CI, 20.1-NR). Grade \u22653 adverse events (AE) occurred in 33/56 patients (58.9%). Dynamic biomarker exploration revealed that baseline IL6 level (>5 pg/mL) predicted better PFS. Moreover, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) status and clearance demonstrated superior survival.\nThe THAG regimen as preoperative therapy showed encouraging clinical activity with a manageable safety profile. Dynamic biomarker findings reveal potential for guiding precision treatment strategies with THAG.",

    "title": "A Computational Pathology Model to Predict Docetaxel Benefit in Localized High-Risk and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Docetaxel improves survival in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) and high-risk localized disease, but benefits vary substantially among patients. Without predictive biomarkers, clinicians cannot identify patients who will benefit, exposing many to unnecessary toxicity. We developed and validated an artificial intelligence-based pathology image classifier (APIC) to predict docetaxel benefit.\nWe analyzed digitized hematoxylin and eosin-stained biopsy specimens from two phase 3 trials: CHAARTED (286/790 patients with mHSPC) and NRG/RTOG 0521 (350/563 patients with high-risk localized disease). APIC used features capturing tumor-immune spatial interactions and nuclear heterogeneity. We evaluated the predictive value of APIC for docetaxel benefit on overall survival (OS) and castration resistance using Cox proportional hazards with interaction terms.\nIn CHAARTED, APIC-positive patients (56.7%) showed significant OS improvement with docetaxel [HR, 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31-0.85; P = 0.008] and delayed castration resistance (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.71; P < 0.001), whereas APIC-negative patients (43.3%) showed no benefit (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.71-2.44; P = 0.39). Treatment-APIC interactions were significant (P = 0.022 and P = 0.031). In NRG/RTOG 0521, APIC-positive patients (44.7%) demonstrated survival benefit (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.92; P = 0.023), whereas APIC-negative patients (55.3%) showed no benefit. Treatment-APIC interaction was significant (P = 0.024). Predictive value remained significant after adjusting for clinical variables. Limitations include retrospective analysis and need for prospective validation.\nAPIC predicts docetaxel benefit in both metastatic and localized prostate cancers, independent of clinical factors. Validation in triplet therapy with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors is needed.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary prostate cancer prognostic models do not include imaging and generally are based on pretreatment parameters. We sought to develop an externally validated model that used novel quantification of soft-tissue and bone disease, integrated with standard clinical and serum biomarkers, at baseline and up to 6 months of treatment.\nTwo randomized phase 3 trials, Cougar COU-AA-302 (NCT00887198; for derivation) and Alliance A031201 (NCT01949337; for validation), were used to evaluate the added value of early on-treatment bone imaging and more than 1,000 radiomics features on CT, used in conjunction with clinical and serum biomarkers in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Predictive accuracy measures were computed to determine whether these early on-treatment biomarkers could reliably sort patients into risk groups that inform overall survival (OS) and whether the patient-specific biomarker risk score could precisely predict their OS time.\nImaging improved patient risk stratification but did not improve individual survival predictions. The strongest risk prediction model was developed for patients with bone-only metastases. This model was also the least complex, relying on just 16 risk factors, whereas all other models were high-dimensional, incorporating approximately 1,100 intercept and 1,100 slope features from the early on-treatment biomarker trajectories.\nPretreatment and early on-treatment serum and automated quantitative imaging markers can well discriminate risk of death. Imaging improves this risk categorization relative to serum biomarkers alone. Such models can give early outcome predictions and can be used in future trials that involve imaging, even using traditional techniques such as bone scintigraphy.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) integration (HPVint) is associated with carcinogenesis and tumor progression in HPV-associated cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Although its impact on human DNA has been well characterized, its relationship with clinical outcomes remains unconfirmed.\nWe analyzed HPVint events from 261 HPV-associated HNSCC bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) samples from five cohorts, including 62 from a new University of Michigan cohort, and DNA HPVint events from 102 HPV(+) HNSCC participants in two of the cohorts. We investigated the consequences of HPVint both with respect to human and HPV gene expression and clinical outcomes (recurrence and overall survival).\nBy leveraging this large meta-cohort of HNSCC, we first reveal an oncogenic gene network based on the recurrent HPVint locations in the human genome and gene expression alterations, highlighting key recurrent and overexpressed genes, including NR4A2, CD274, and CCER1, and genes from the CAMK and KLF families. We then stratify HPVint-positive participants by risk using HPV RNA features, specifically spliced HPV-human fusion transcripts (E1* integration) and HPV gene expression ratios, showing that subsets of participants have worse clinical outcomes based on these two candidate biomarkers.\nBy focusing on RNA instead of DNA, we expand our understanding of the carcinogenic mechanisms of HPVint, in part addressing the conflicting findings of whether HPVint is associated with aggressive phenotypes and worse clinical consequences, and provide potential biomarkers to advance precision oncology in HPV-associated HNSCC. Newly identified genes with recurrent integration events may serve as candidates for targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "To accelerate prostate cancer drug development and identification of promising therapies, we aimed to establish a framework for a multimodal therapy (MMT) approach using intermediate endpoints of efficacy due to treatment.\nIn the MetaCURE trial, patients with untreated, high-risk localized (cohort A) or low-volume metastatic (cohort B) disease were randomized 1:1 to apalutamide or apalutamide and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and androgen deprivation therapy for 10 months. Cohort B also received stereotactic body radiotherapy (RT) at 4 months. All patients underwent a radical prostatectomy (6 months \u00b1 postoperative RT at 10 months). The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR; no residual tumor) or minimal residual disease (MRD; \u22645 mm residual carcinoma), and the secondary endpoint an undetectable PSA following testosterone (T) recovery (T \u2265 150 ng/dL) at 24 months.\nA pCR or MRD was achieved in 4 [12%; 90% confidence interval (CI), 4%-26%] and 5 (15%; 90% CI, 6%-29%) patients in cohorts A and B, respectively. Undetectable PSA and T-recovery at 24 months occurred in 20 (61%; 95% CI, 42%-77%) patients in cohort A and 13 (39%; 95% CI, 23%-58%) patients in cohort B.\nMMT for newly diagnosed high-risk localized and low-volume metastatic prostate cancer is feasible, safe, and provides a rapid readout of efficacy. A significant proportion of patients, including those with oligometastatic disease, maintained an undetectable PSA following T-recovery at the 2-year endpoint. These results have informed the design of an adaptive trial using MMT on a continuous basis to prioritize effective approaches for further study.",

Cabozantinib alters the tumor microenvironment to be more permissive to immune cells by reducing the presence of regulatory T cells and CD14+ monocytes. This trial investigated the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced epNET.\nThis was an open-label, single-arm, phase II trial, which enrolled patients with advanced epNET. Patients received nivolumab 240 mg i.v. on days 1 and 15 and cabozantinib 40 mg orally once daily on a 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1. Using a Simon two-stage design, 19 patients were enrolled in the first stage. Secondary objectives included ORR by immune-related RECIST, PFS, and safety. Exploratory objectives included correlation between immune and angiogenic proteomic profile and clinical outcomes.\nEighteen of the 19 enrolled patients were evaluable for response. Best response was partial response in one (5%), stable disease in 16 (90%), and progressive disease in one patient (5%). The ORR did not meet goal for the first stage, so enrollment was terminated. The median PFS was 5.6 months (95% confidence interval, 3.5-9.9). Grade 3 toxicities attributed to the combination included tumor lysis (n = 1, 5%), elevated transaminases (n = 1, 5%), and fatigue (n = 2, 10%). Immune and angiogenic proteomic profiles demonstrated trends associated with longer time on therapy.\nCabozantinib and nivolumab were associated with limited response in patients with epNET.

This phase Ib open-label, multicenter dose-escalation and -expansion study (NCT02350673) evaluated the safety, activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CA plus atezolizumab in patients with advanced/metastatic CEA-positive solid tumors.\nPatients received escalating doses of CA (6-20/25 mg) with fixed dosages of atezolizumab (840 mg) every 2 weeks or escalating dosages of CA weekly (10-15/20 mg) with fixed dosages of atezolizumab (1,200 mg) every 3 weeks. Primary objectives include maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose for expansion (RDE), and safety.\nTwenty-four patients were randomized to receive CA plus atezolizumab every 2 weeks and 45 patients to CA weekly plus atezolizumab every 3 weeks. A subgroup of patients (n = 5) received obinutuzumab before treatment to study the prevention of antidrug antibodies. The MTD was not determined; 15 mg weekly or 20 mg every 2 weeks of CA plus atezolizumab was the RDE. The safety profile was consistent with CA monotherapy and atezolizumab-based therapies. The addition of atezolizumab did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of CA, and treatment induced the proliferation of T and NK cells in the blood without Treg expansion. Increases in pharmacodynamic markers (C-reactive protein, lymphocytes, sCD25, and cytokines) suggested immune activation despite limited antitumor activity (overall response rate: 13.5% with weekly/every-3-week regimen).\nThe safety profile of this combination was manageable. Prominent pharmacodynamic effects were elucidated; antitumor activity was limited.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains refractory to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies because of its immunosuppressive microenvironment and a dense extracellular matrix deposited by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CALF), which impair CAR T-cell infiltration. To address these barriers, we previously developed a dual-targeting CAR-TEAM platform in which mesothelin-specific CAR T cells secrete a fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeting T-cell engager antibody molecule (TEAM) to simultaneously kill tumor cells and CALF. In this study, we leveraged mesothelin-targeting CAR T cells and tested rational drug combinations and optimal delivery strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and guide potential combinations that could be incorporated into a clinical study.\nTumor mesothelin shedding by proteases and CAR T-cell dysfunction remain key obstacles to CAR T-cell efficacy. Using preclinical PDAC models, we tested mesothelin-targeting CAR T cells in combination with agents that increase tumor mesothelin expression, promote T-cell polarization and persistence, and support T-cell function. Furthermore, we compared intravenous versus intraperitoneal delivery routes to treat peritoneal metastases.\nWe demonstrated that ibrutinib enhanced CAR T-cell expansion, Th1 skewing, and antitumor activity in PDAC. PD-1 blockade synergistically improved CAR T-cell antitumor function in a patient-derived PDAC xenograft and intraperitoneal delivery proved superior against peritoneal disease. Conversely, although an ADAM-10/-17 inhibitor prevented mesothelin shedding and improved tumor killing in vitro, it did not enhance efficacy in vivo.\nThese findings identify clinically actionable strategies to optimize CAR T-cell therapy against PDAC. A phase I clinical trial testing meso-FAP CAR-TEAM T cells, alone or in combination with ibrutinib or PD-1 blockade, is in development.",

Immune markers were measured in tumor cores and margins by multiplex IHC.\nAt a median follow-up of 47.4 months, the median overall survival (OS) and 2-year OS rate were 12.7 months and 32% in all evaluable patients (n = 88) and 17.5 months and 35% in patients who had no prior therapy for R/M HNSCC (n = 43). The survival efficacy was similar between patients with p16-negative and p16-positive tumors, but the response rate was significantly higher in patients with p16-negative tumors. The clonal tumor mutational burden, hypoxia score, and EGFR pathway score were significantly higher in p16-negative compared with p16-positive tumors. Loss of heterozygosity of MHC class I was significantly more frequent in nonresponders, and APOBEC-associated mutagenesis was elevated in responders. Gene expression profiling and multiplex IHC analyses revealed a more inflamed tumor microenvironment in responders regardless of p16 status.\nOur long-term follow-up study indicates that the combination of cetuximab and nivolumab is efficacious and tolerable and that patients with p16-negative R/M HNSCC may have greater benefit from this combination.",

Cell uptake assays, small-animal PET imaging, and biodistribution studies were performed to evaluate its targeting ability. In the first-in-human study, eight patients with suspected HCC underwent [68Ga]Ga-XH-06 PET/MRI. Radiotracer uptake in tumors and normal tissues was quantified, and tumor-to-blood ratios and tumor-to-liver ratios were calculated.\n[68Ga]Ga-XH-06 was synthesized with high radiochemical purity and exhibited specific uptake and efficient internalization in GPC3-positive cells. In subcutaneous and orthotopic animal models, [68Ga]Ga-XH-06 effectively visualized HCC tumors. Eight patients underwent [68Ga]Ga-XH-06 PET/MRI scans, and no adverse events were observed. The radiotracer successfully detected HCC lesions, including subcentimeter tumors, with high imaging contrast. Among seven patients with HCC, the median maximum standardized uptake value of the lesions was 16.9 (range, 8.2-51.8), the median tumor-to-liver ratio was 6.2 (range, 2.8-24.7), and the median tumor-to-blood ratio was 16.6 (range, 3.0-57.6) at 2.5 hours after injection.\n[68Ga]Ga-XH-06 is clinically promising for detecting GPC3-positive HCC with a favorable safety profile. Further investigation is warranted to validate the clinical value of GPC3-targeted PET imaging in HCC management. See related commentary by Seo and Flavell, p. 445.",
