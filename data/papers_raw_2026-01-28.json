    "title": "Allosteric targeting with antiviral nucleotide analogues allows fine-tuning of SAMHD1 dNTPase activity.",
    "abstract": "SAMHD1 is a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) hydrolase that controls intracellular dNTP pools and plays diverse roles in human health and disease. Notably, this enzymatic activity also confers chemotherapy resistance by hydrolysing the active triphosphate forms of nucleoside analogue drugs, thereby reducing their efficacy and contributing to worse treatment outcomes in cancer patients. The dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 is tightly regulated by allosteric activation and oligomerisation through binding of (d)NTPs to two allosteric sites, the first of which - allosteric site 1 (AS1) - requires binding of a guanine nucleotide. In the present study, we investigated strategies to pharmacologically modulate SAMHD1 dNTPase activity via AS1. Using a variety of biochemical and biophysical assays, we demonstrate that the antiviral guanine nucleotide analogues acyclovir- and ganciclovir-triphosphate are potent AS1 binders that induce the formation of enzymatically competent SAMHD1 tetramers, however with reduced enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we show that AS1 activator identity can fine-tune dNTPase activity towards different dNTP substrates, providing a new avenue to pharmacologically control SAMHD1. This differential activity of acyclovir- and ganciclovir-triphosphate-activated SAMHD1 can be explained by distinct kinetic profiles that deviate from Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, based on an apparent synergistic activation between these nucleotide analogues and the physiological AS1 activator GTP, we also propose the existence of mixed-occupancy SAMHD1 tetramers. Our work therefore provides new insights into the allosteric activation and oligomerisation process of SAMHD1 and opens new avenues to pharmacologically control the dNTPase activity utilising non-natural allosteric ligands.",

    "title": "Mannose metabolic pathway senses glucose supply and regulates cell fate decisions.",
    "abstract": "Mammalian cells exploit diverse metabolic pathways to regulate cell fates during glucose deprivation. We previously reported that glucose deprivation lowers the metabolic activity of mannose pathway that is interconnected with glycolysis, leading to biosynthetic arrest and degradation of the glycan precursors for asparagine-linked glycosylation (N-glycosylation) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the cellular role of this sequential metabolic response remains unknown, largely due to metabolic complications caused by glucose deprivation. Here, we genetically engineered cells to separate mannose pathway from glycolysis, allowing precise control of mannose pathway activity by adjusting mannose supply levels instead of changing glucose supply. Moderate decrease in mannose supply severely suppressed N-glycosylation, leading to activation of pro-survival PERK-eIF2 signals. Although further decrease in mannose supply to the minimal levels did not compromise cell survival, it depleted luminal protective glycocalyx of lysosomes and increased a risk of cell death by impairing lysosome integrity. These results indicate that low metabolic flux of glucose into mannose pathway initiates alterations in homeostasis of the ER and lysosomes, at least in part through N-glycosylation defects, leading to cell fate decisions.",

    "title": "A conserved salt bridge network stabilizes the hepatic organic anion transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.",
    "abstract": "The organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)-1B1 and -1B3 are liver-specific transporters that govern the uptake of numerous endogenous molecules and drugs before their metabolism and excretion by the hepatocytes. Structurally, these two transporters are members of the major facilitator superfamily, operating by the alternating access mechanism that facilitates the movement of solutes between extracellular and intracellular compartments. Given their dynamic nature, salt bridges often modulate the conformations of transporters and participate in the orchestration of conformational changes. In this study, we identified and characterized a network of salt bridges within the internal cavities of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by cell-based uptake assays, uptake kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. These experiments revealed that a salt bridge network centered around E185 is crucial for uptake activities in these two proteins, as it stabilizes the inward cavity of the proteins and bridges the N- and C- bundles of the protein. Interestingly, this salt bridge network changes as a function of conformation. Furthermore, the residues studied do not participate in ligand coordination in the published structures nor in our simulations. These findings advance our understanding of the elaborate network of ionic interactions that govern the structure and dynamics of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and other MFS transporters.",

    "abstract": "The MttB superfamily member MtgB catalyzes the methylation of a cognate corrinoid protein with glycine betaine and representatives have been described from both bacteria and archaea. Here we focused on MtgB from Desulfitobacterium hafniense, a protein for which a crystal structure had been previously obtained. We employed different programs to predict the binding of glycine betaine and identified a consensus binding site. The modelled binding site consisted of two aromatic residues, Y97 and a F356, which are both proposed to interact with the quaternary amine portion of glycine betaine via pi:cation interactions. Additionally, two basic residues, H348 and R312, were proposed to interact with the carboxylate group. We carried out site directed substitutions and subsequently tested the necessity of these residues for glycine betaine:cob(I)alamin methyltransferase activity. These experiments supported a role in catalysis for each residue, presumably in placement of glycine betaine at proper position for nucleophilic attack by the Co(I) ion of cobalamin. Subsequently, the structure of the glycine betaine bound enzyme was obtained and confirmed the interaction of these residues with glycine betaine. Other MttB superfamily members with specificity for different quaternary amines were modeled and compared with the glycine betaine bound structure of MtgB. The nitrogen of each quaternary amine was brought within an average value of 1.8 \u00c5 to each other, suggesting that members of the superfamily bring their methyl groups into nearly the same space within the TIM barrel prior to methyl group transfer to cob(I)alamin.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with variable clinical outcomes. Centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55) has been involved in the progression of multiple cancers, but its function in PCa is still largely uncharacterized. CEP55 expression was evaluated in clinical samples and cell lines via bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blot (WB). Functional assessments, such as wound healing, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), and Transwell invasion, were carried out to evaluate the impact of CEP55 upregulation or knockdown on PCa cell growth and metastasis. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was utilized to observe the interaction between CEP55 and TPX2 microtubule nucleation factor (TPX2). The role of CEP55 in ferroptosis regulation was assessed by measuring IC50 values of ferroptosis inducers, lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the expression of ferroptosis-correlated proteins Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Xenograft tumor models were created to evaluate the in vivo effects of CEP55 suppression. CEP55 showed a significant upregulation in PCa tissues and cell lines. CEP55 overexpression was linked to advanced clinicopathological features and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, CEP55 interacted with TPX2 to activate the Aurora Kinase A (AURKA)-PI3K/AKT signaling cascade. This activation led to increased expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4, reduced lipid ROS accumulation, and conferred resistance to ferroptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of the TPX2/AURKA interaction with CAM2602 reversed these effects. In vivo trials illustrated that CEP55 knockdown inhibited tumor growth and downregulated key proteins in the TPX2/AURKA/PI3K/AKT and ferroptosis resistance pathway. Our findings demonstrate that CEP55 enhances PCa progression by stimulating the TPX2/AURKA/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and inhibiting ferroptosis. Targeting this axis may represent a potential therapeutic approach for PCa.",

    "abstract": "The biologically active metabolite of Vitamin A, retinoic acid, is essential for regulating immune tolerance, development, and metabolism. A key regulator of retinoic acid signalling is its synthesis by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, whose expression is tightly regulated and cell-type specific. Current cell-based assays for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase activity rely on fluorescent aldehyde substrates, which lack specificity, limiting their accuracy and interpretability. Here, we developed a sensitive, cell-based assay that directly quantifies retinaldehyde dehydrogenase activity by measuring a panel of retinoids, including all-trans-retinoic acid, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Employing cultured conventional dendritic cells, we demonstrate that retinoic acid synthesis is time-, substrate-, and enzyme-dependent. Compared to fluorescence-based assays, our assay avoided artefactual signals influenced by cell density and provided a direct, quantitative measure of enzymatic activity in the context of broader retinoid metabolism. This assay offers additional practical advantages, including flexibility in sample processing and compatibility with other downstream metabolite analyses. Together, our protocol provides a robust, specific, and functionally-relevant approach that complements existing fluorescence-based approaches to study retinoic acid biosynthesis in immune cells and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) biosynthesizes core fucose on N-glycans, which plays essential roles in various biological processes, including immunity and development. Although FUT8 is a Golgi-resident type II membrane protein, it is also secreted by an unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and signal peptide peptidase-like 3 (SPPL3), members of an intramembrane protease family, both cleave FUT8 for secretion. Knockout (KO) of SPP or SPPL3 in cells partially impaired FUT8 secretion, and double KO led to more drastic impairment in secretion, indicating that SPP and SPPL3 independently cleave FUT8. Sequencing analysis revealed that the N-terminus of FUT8 in the media was mapped in the stem region, which is far from the expected cleavage site for SPP/SPPL3, suggesting that FUT8 undergoes two-step proteolytic processing, initially by SPP/SPPL3 and subsequently by another protease. Moreover, glycoproteomics suggested that the substrate glycoprotein preference of FUT8 was altered by knocking out SPP or SPPL3, highlighting the importance of FUT8 shedding in core fucosylation.",

Here, we provide a spatially resolved single-cell atlas of sex-differentially expressed (sex-DE) genes in the human ARC and VMH. We identify neuronal populations governing hypothalamus-specific functions, define their spatial distributions, and show enrichment of sex-DE in retinoid metabolism- and retinoid receptor-regulated genes. Within the ARC and VMH, we find correlated autosomal expression differences localized to ESR1/TAC3-expressing and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2)-expressing neurons and extensive sex-DE genes linked to sex-biased disorders, including autism, depression, and schizophrenia. Our molecular mapping of disease associations to hypothalamic cell types with established roles in sex-divergent physiology and behavior provides insights into the mechanistic bases of sex bias in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

This vaccine combined an FP conjugate with a cocktail of engineered Env trimers with enhanced V2 apex recognition and increased antigen retention in lymph nodes. Macaque immunization with the dual-epitope vaccine elicited >1,000-fold higher autologous tier 2-neutralizing titers than wild-type Env trimers and enhanced heterologous neutralization. Both FP- and V2 apex-monoclonal antibodies were isolated from immunized macaques and showed heterologous neutralization with genetic and structural signatures similar to well-characterized FP and V2 apex bNAbs.

NE activates calcium transients in radial astrocytes through \u03b11-adrenergic receptors. NE and radial astrocyte activation shift OT response selectivity to preferentially respond to looming stimuli, associated with predation threat. NE-mediated astrocytic release of ATP/adenosine reduces excitatory transmission by retinal ganglion cell axons, without affecting inhibitory transmission in the OT. Blockade of adenosine receptors prevents both decreased neurotransmission and the selectivity shift. Chemogenetic activation of tectal radial astrocytes mimics NE's effects and enhances behavioral detection of looming stimuli in freely swimming animals, whereas chelating calcium in astrocytes to block transients prevents the selectivity shift. NE signaling via radial astrocytes improves network signal-to-noise for detecting threatening stimuli, with important implications for sensory processing and behavior.",

Nutrient transport across the lysosomal membrane is coupled to its sensing by specialized signaling complexes on the cytoplasmic face, which, in response, mediate communication with other organelles and control cell-wide programs for growth, catabolism, and stress response. Lysosomes acquire specialized sensing-signaling features in immune cells, where they shape antigen processing, innate immune signaling, and inflammatory cell death, and in neurons, where they act as sentinels of proteostatic and mitochondrial stress, supporting local translation, organelle quality control, and neuroimmune crosstalk.

Moreover, their ultrastructural peculiarities enable tight regulation of fluxes across the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. As organelles of proteobacterial origin, mitochondria harbor danger signals and require protection from the consequences of membrane damage by efficient quality control mechanisms. However, mitochondria have also been co-opted by eukaryotic cells to react to cellular damage and promote effective immune responses.

    "abstract": "Impaired muscle strength and mitochondrial functionality are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Conventional combined resistance/endurance exercise training has limited efficacy to simultaneously improve muscle function and metabolism. We examined whether low-load blood-flow restriction training (BFRT) increases both muscle strength and mitochondrial oxidative capacity in T2D. Over 12 weeks, BFRT and conventional resistance training (CREST) similarly improved muscle strength despite lower workload in BFRT. Uniquely, BFRT enhanced muscle and adipose tissue oxidative capacity and increased muscle mitochondrial content. Transcriptomic profiling revealed more pronounced changes, particularly in angiogenesis-linked pathways, upon BFRT. BFRT also preferentially led to reductions in visceral adipose tissue volume and waist circumference, whereas CREST more effectively decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue volume. Both interventions lowered resting heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. These findings position BFRT as a promising low-load exercising strategy to simultaneously improve mitochondrial oxidative capacity, muscle strength, and body composition in individuals with T2D.",

    "abstract": "The ring-shaped sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) enables DNA polymerases to perform processive DNA synthesis during replication and repair. The loading of PCNA onto DNA is catalyzed by the ATPase clamp-loader replication factor C (RFC). Using a single-molecule platform to visualize the dynamic interplay between PCNA and RFC on DNA, we unexpectedly discovered that RFC continues to associate with PCNA after loading, contrary to the conventional view. Functionally, this clamp-loader/clamp (CLC) complex is required for processive DNA synthesis by polymerase \u1e9f (Pol\u1e9f), as the PCNA-Pol\u1e9f assembly is inherently unstable. This architectural role of RFC is dependent on the BRCA1 C-terminal homology (BRCT) domain of Rfc1, and mutation of its DNA-binding residues causes sensitivity to genotoxic stress in vivo. We further showed that flap endonuclease I (FEN1) can also stabilize the PCNA-Pol\u1e9f interaction and mediate robust synthesis. Overall, our work revealed that, beyond their canonical enzymatic functions, PCNA-binding proteins harbor non-catalytic functions important for DNA replication and genome maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Although ATP-independent chaperones assist RNA folding, the mechanisms by which they function remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate how two RNA chaperones collaborate to unfold misfolded noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The ring-shaped Ro60 protein binds the ends of misfolded ncRNAs in its cavity, whereas La stabilizes nascent ncRNAs and assists their folding. Using cryo-electron microscopy to resolve the structure of a misfolded RNA complexed with Ro60 and La, we show that La cradles the Ro60 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), with its N-terminal domain binding the RNA 3' end after it passes through the Ro60 cavity, while its C-terminal domain destabilizes structures in the misfolded RNA body. Using selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP), we show that La and Ro60 function synergistically to unfold non-native structures. As the RNAs bound by Ro60 and La include both ncRNA precursors and ncRNAs with oligouridine tails, this RNA chaperone machine may function widely to recognize misfolded and otherwise aberrant ncRNAs and assist their unfolding.",

Genetically tractable commensals, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, offer promising chassis for engineering biosensors but lack modular systems for precise sensing and reporting. Here, we developed genetic tools for B. thetaiotaomicron, including (1) repressible promoters for tunable fluorescent protein expression, (2) a DNA-based system to modulate repressor activity, (3) a modular, fluorescence-based transcriptional reporter circuit, and (4) an alternative plasmid integration mode. Using these components, we engineered biosensors to detect increased gut osmolality caused by malabsorption and validated them in vitro and in a murine model of laxative-induced osmotic diarrhea. These biosensors enabled long-term, non-invasive reporting of gut osmolality from single-cell fluorescence, demonstrating the potential of gut bacteria as monitoring platforms in gut health applications.",

HDM accelerated tumor growth without altering mutational burden. Transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed tissue-specific effects: in normal lung, HDM enhanced pro-inflammatory and immune activation programs, whereas in tumors it suppressed T cell responses, antigen presentation, and chemokine signaling. Immune deconvolution showed a shift toward myeloid enrichment and lymphoid suppression, with reduced cytotoxic T and NK signatures. Notably, HDM-driven tumor promotion was abolished in Il17a",

This study revealed that MTF improves insulin sensitivity by promoting the proliferation and translocation of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) originating from the intestine. MTF enhances the growth of IgA-ASCs in Peyer's patches, increasing their migration to insulin-sensitive tissues such as the liver and visceral adipose tissue. Within these tissues, these cells secrete the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10), promoting insulin signaling transduction. Crucially, the absence of B cells or IL-10 in IgA-ASCs abolishes MTF's insulin sensitivity improvement, unlike the absence of IgA or the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), which is a protein mediating mucosal IgA secretion. The mechanism involves MTF stimulating the expansion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing bacteria, leading to increased LPS production and consequently enhancing intestinal IgA responses through TLR4.",

While cellular \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) levels fluctuate with metabolic state, the functional significance of these fluctuations for development remains poorly defined. Here, this study uncovers an evolutionarily conserved mechanism whereby \u03b1-KG directly regulates Hippo signaling activity during development. We demonstrate that elevated \u03b1-KG promotes the degradation of Yki, the key Hippo pathway effector in Drosophila, in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanistically, \u03b1-KG drives PH4\u03b1EFB-mediated prolyl hydroxylation of specific proline residues in Yki, thereby targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Critically, mutation of these hydroxylation sites of Yki abolishes its sensitivity to \u03b1-KG, resulting in Yki protein hyperstabilization, aberrant activation of Hippo targets, and organ overgrowth in Drosophila. Overall, these findings establish \u03b1-KG as a central metabolic regulator of Hippo activity, thereby coupling metabolic status to developmental growth control.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq and scRNA-seq identify unannotated transcripts across cell types; whether they are coding or noncoding, normal or erroneous, and functional or junk remains largely uncharacterized. Unannotated noncoding transcripts (UNTs) are of special interest because ncRNAs can function by directly interacting with other molecules. Previous studies reported several functional UNTs in tumors, but none systematically examined their extent and mechanisms.\nWe first performed a pan-cancer analysis, including cell lines and tissues of four tumors, to identify unannotated genes and transcripts (including UNTs). Many unannotated genes and transcripts show significant differential expression. We then predicted potential DNA-binding domains (DBDs) within UNTs and their DNA-binding sites (DBSs) in the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). To reveal whether and how UNTs regulate transcription, we investigated three UNTs (labeled as MSTRG.2513.6, MSTRG.4401.1, and MSTRG.34636.7) whose genomic regions overlap BCAN-AS2, LNCAROD, and LINC00513. We deleted their predicted DBD in two cancer cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9, performed RNA sequencing and cell experiments before and after DBD deletion, identified DEGs using three methods, analyzed enriched signaling pathways, and analyzed transcriptional regulatory modules. DBD deletion causes not only differential gene expression but also altered cell phenotypes.\nThe results suggest that many UNTs can transcriptionally regulate genes, and this regulation is highly cancer- and species-specific. Because UNTs are widely expressed in cancer and other diseased cells, they may be an important class of transcriptional regulators. Their cell and species specificity may help explain inconsistencies across studies and species and make them potential disease-specific targets.",

    "abstract": "Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection is a significant but underrecognized complication, commonly linked not only to aplastic anemia but also pancytopenia, especially in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. While B19V's tropism for erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) is well-documented, its restriction to EPCs fails to fully explain the pathogenesis of pancytopenia. In this study, we used PrimeFlow RNA assay, and single-cell full-length transcriptome sequencing (scFAST-seq) to show that B19V could infect hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and initiate viral transcription, resulting in increased apoptosis, impaired self-renewal and multilineage differentiation of HSCs, which may contribute directly to pancytopenia. Further analysis revealed that B19V could activate the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway in HSCs to promote viral persistence. Pharmacological inhibition with baricitinib markedly reduced the viral load and partially restored hematopoietic differentiation capacity in vitro. Taken together, our findings reveal B19V as a previously unrecognized HSC-tropic virus that disrupts function of HSCs and may drive pancytopenia. Targeting the JAK2/STAT5 signaling by baricitinib shows promising therapeutic potential for reversing virus-induced bone marrow failure. This work not only deepens our understanding of viral tropism and pathogenesis in the hematopoietic niche, but also opens up new possibilities for treating bone marrow damage after transplantation and in other hematological diseases.",

This study uncovers the pivotal role of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness in driving ATC aggressiveness through mechanotransduction mediated by the Integrin \u03b16\u03b24/Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) axis. By engineering collagen-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels with tunable rigidity, we demonstrated that high ECM stiffness (60\u2009kPa) markedly enhanced ATC cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, stiff matrices induced cytoskeletal reorganization, activated RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42 signaling, and upregulated Integrin \u03b16\u03b24-FAK pathway components, as validated by transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional assays. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK reversed stiffness-dependent tumor-promoting effects in vitro. In vivo, mice injected with tumor cells pre-cultured on high-stiffness ECM-mimicking hydrogels exhibited accelerated subcutaneous tumor growth and increased lung metastatic burden, which were significantly attenuated by FAK-targeted therapy. These findings establish ECM stiffness as a biomechanical determinant of ATC progression and metastasis, offering novel insights into microenvironment-driven malignancy and highlighting FAK as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt mechanosignaling in ATC.",

Here, we perform multi-omics data analysis and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of biological samples from patients in the CBCSG010 clinical trial who were randomized to receive adjuvant docetaxel-anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without capecitabine. We find that patients with a better prognosis in the capecitabine group exhibited an immune-inflamed microenvironment and upregulation of interferon pathways. Moreover, we identify interferon-related TANK-binding kinase 1-binding protein 1 (TBKBP1) as the key gene involved in capecitabine resistance. We uncover that TBKBP1 promotes capecitabine resistance through impairment of activated immune cells infiltration in vivo. Mechanistically, TBKBP1 negatively regulates type I interferon pathway activated by capecitabine treatment, by promoting autophagy-mediated protein degradation of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1). In summary, our study implicates TBKBP1 in mediating capecitabine resistance and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of death among women, with the HER2+ subtype being particularly aggressive due to acquired resistance to HER2-targeted therapies. Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, represses the expression of genetic programs crucial for differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. To investigate the role of EZH2 in HER2+ tumor progression, we crossed a genetically engineered mouse model of HER2-driven breast cancer with a conditional Ezh2 knockout strain and showed that Ezh2 is essential for accelerating tumor initiation and metastatic dissemination. Combined bulk and single cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed a significant downregulation of basal cell populations in the absence of Ezh2, and an upregulation of luminal progenitor cell populations, driven by crucial transcription factors such as Esr1. Further, inhibition of EZH2 in vitro resulted in increased expression of ER in HER2+ human breast cancer cell lines and conferred sensitivity to Tamoxifen. These findings demonstrate that EZH2 dictates cancer plasticity and provides rationale for combining EZH2 inhibitors with endocrine therapies to improve HER2+ breast cancer outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The activation of PLK1 in late G2 is critical for mitotic entry, requiring its phosphorylation by Aurora-A, facilitated by the intrinsically disordered protein Bora. The structural basis of this mechanism has remained unresolved. Here, we present models of the Aurora-A/Bora complex and the Aurora-A/Bora/PLK1 complex, validated with site-specific mutagenesis, biochemical assays and NMR spectroscopy. Bora wraps around the N-lobe of Aurora-A, occupying the pockets used by its other activators. A CDK1 phosphorylation site on Bora (Ser112) mimics the structural role of Aurora-A activation loop phosphorylation within a TPX2-like binding motif. In the ternary complex, Bora bridges the two kinases, orienting the activation loop of PLK1 towards the active site of Aurora-A. Bora residues 56-66 form a critical interface with a conserved pocket on the PLK1 C-helix that is analogous to the TPX2-binding Y-pocket of Aurora-A. Aurora-A phosphorylation of Bora Ser59 creates an additional interaction that increases the efficiency of PLK1 phosphorylation. These findings deepen our understanding of Aurora-A regulation by its disordered binding partners and establish a mechanistic framework for Bora-dependent activation of PLK1.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important source of gene innovation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Several genes acquired by hosts of parasitoid wasps via HGT have been reported to protect hosts from parasitoid wasps. In contrast, little is known about whether HGT-acquired genes in parasitoid wasps are involved in attacking their hosts. Here, we report a prokaryote-type CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (PTCDS) gene that was horizontally transferred into the last common ancestor of two parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma and L. syphax, from the bacterial family Rickettsiaceae. We experimentally demonstrated that PTCDS is linked to ensure the appropriate storage amount of venom in the venom reservoir of parasitoid wasps. PTCDS knockdown downregulated the expression of certain vesicle-mediated transport genes, thereby reducing the secretion of venom into venom reservoir without altering its composition. This resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of encapsulated wasp eggs in parasitized hosts, ultimately leading to host immune-mediated killing. We conclude that parasitoid wasps use the foreign gene PTCDS to influence venom amounts against host defence, providing new insight into the arms race between parasitoid wasps and hosts.",

    "abstract": "Activation of PLK1, a master mitotic kinase, requires phosphorylation of its activation segment on Thr210, within a basic consensus sequence for Aurora kinases. Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation of Thr210 has been reported, but other evidence identified a strict requirement for the Aurora A partner Bora for Thr210 phosphorylation. Here, we investigate the elusive mechanistic basis for this requirement. We show that Aurora A:Bora phosphorylates Thr210 of PLK1 in vitro. On the contrary, T210 was not phosphorylated by isolated Aurora A, additional Aurora A:activator complexes, or Aurora B:INCENP, even when used at high kinase/substrate ratios. A transient interaction of Bora and PLK1, identified by structural modeling and probed mutationally, is uniquely required for Thr210 phosphorylation. Dependency on Bora for Thr210 phosphorylation is eliminated after mutating Lys208, in the Aurora consensus, into arginine. This conservative mutation turns PLK1 into a substrate of nearly all tested active Aurora kinases, including Aurora B. Collectively, these results shine a new light on the specificity of the PLK1 activation mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved, intrinsically disordered protein Bora is critical for initiating the activation of mitotic kinases. Once phosphorylated at Ser112 by Cycling A-Cdk1 kinase, phospho-Bora activates unphosphorylated Aurora A kinase (AURKA), directing it towards Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), thus promoting Cycling B-Cdk1 activation and mitotic entry. Here, by combining structural modeling and in vitro assays, we provide evidence that Bora wraps around the N-terminal lobe of AURKA to position its phospho-Ser112 near AURKA's T-loop, mimicking T-loop phosphorylation. Additionally, Bora transiently interacts with the \u03b1C helix of the Plk1 kinase domain through a conserved motif, guiding AURKA activity towards the Plk1 T-loop, which is otherwise impervious to phosphorylation by AURKA. We highlight the importance of this motif for Bora function in vitro and during mitotic entry in Xenopus laevis egg extracts. Our results reveal critical molecular details of mitotic kinase activation, which could lead to the development of pathway-specific inhibitors.",

Chromatin repair entails the deposition of new histones at sites of DNA damage. How this is coordinated with parental histone dynamics for the maintenance of chromatin states is unknown. To bridge this knowledge gap, here we devise a novel proteomic strategy to characterize dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape during the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions in human cells, in a quantitative, unbiased and time-resolved manner. Thus, we identify the histone chaperones DNAJC9 and MCM2 as central players in chromatin repair. DNAJC9 provides new H3-H4 histones to CAF-1 and HIRA chaperones for deposition into chromatin and stimulates old H3-H4 histone recovery. MCM2 cooperates with DNAJC9 to coordinate old and new histone dynamics during UV damage repair. Together, our proteomic dataset provides a molecular framework for further dissecting epigenome maintenance mechanisms.",

Here, we introduce an optical Ising machine based on spontaneous polarization symmetry breaking in a coherently driven fiber Kerr nonlinear resonator. In our architecture, the spins are encoded in the polarization state, allowing robust, all-intensity readout with off-the-shelf telecom components. By operating in a newly-discovered regime where nonlinearity and topology lock the system's symmetry, we eliminate drift and bias, enabling uninterrupted Ising trials at optical speeds for over an hour, without manual intervention. This all-fiber platform not only simplifies the hardware but also opens a path to more stable, high-throughput coherent optical optimization devices for applications from finance to drug design and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi apparatus is a central hub for protein trafficking and signaling, yet its rapid imaging and cell-selective disruption remain challenging. Here, we report cycling molecular assemblies (CyMA) for fast Golgi imaging and cell-selective interference. CyMA precursors are acetylated amphiphilic thiopeptides that traverse plasma membrane and are deacetylated by intracellular thioesterases. This exposes thiols that undergo palmitoylation by Golgi-resident palmitoyl acyltransferases utilizing palmitoyl-CoA. The resulting palmitoylated peptides self-assemble into dynamic nanostructures (i.e., CyMA) localized at the\u00a0Golgi. Their continuous, reversible S-acylation enables near-instantaneous Golgi imaging. Replacing fluorophore with a biphenyl motif promotes CyMA accumulation and disrupts functions such as protein modifications, trafficking, and secretion, leading to cell death. This study establishes dynamic supramolecular assembly as an active and selective strategy for Golgi-targeting, pleiotropically interfering with Golgi functions, which may be applicable to targeting other organelles by utilizing alternative enzyme switches to enable kinetic trapping.",

Herein, structurally resembling the MPhS-C2 donor, 3-allylrhodanine (3-AR) as a SA enables precise control over the active layer morphology. Interesting, combined theoretical calculations and thin-film morphology analyses reveal 3-AR preferentially interacts with acceptor N3, thereby directing morphology evolution. Moreover, 3-AR effectively narrows the film formation window, suppressing lateral over-aggregation and crystallization, while promoting vertical donor-acceptor homogeneity. This optimized morphology synergistically facilitates efficient charge dissociation and collection, suppresses both bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination, and extends the lifetimes of excitons and charge carriers. Therefore, the 3-AR-treated MPhS-C2:N3 device achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.43% (certified 18.16%)-the highest reported for binary ASM-OSCs.

Costs were derived from hospital records, and effectiveness was evaluated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and PrEP-adherence days (PADs). Among 442 participants (247 intervention, 195 standard care), incremental costs per QALY gained for the smart pillbox intervention were $19,575.93 (health system), $19,656.66 (multipayer), and $19,844.42 (societal)-all below the cost-effectiveness threshold of three times per capita gross domestic product ($31,200). Costs per PAD gained were $30.46-$30.86, achieving >95% probability of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $47.50-$48.50 per PAD.

Neuronal responses to the omission of expected sounds were time-locked to expected stimulus onset, localized to layer 1-4 of higher auditory area (Temporal Association Area, TeA), and continued to rise until the following stimulus. The omission responses differed from offset and deviant responses in their temporal shape, size and spatial localization. Omissions and sequence statistics correlated with behavioral changes by timed pupil dilation and rapid facial motions. While stimulus responses showed partial entrainment, omission responses maintained a distinct, unentrained shape. The localized omission response in TeA is consistent with a hierarchical organization of predictive processing.

LNPDB also supports future data contributions for continued growth. We examine the utility of LNPDB through two applications: advancing our deep learning model for predicting LNP delivery performance, and simulating bilayer dynamics to identify structural features - bilayer stability and critical packing parameter - that correlate with LNP delivery performance. Altogether, LNPDB provides the digital framework for LNP modeling and data-driven rational design.",

    "title": "Training tactile sensors to learn force sensing from each other.",
    "abstract": "Humans achieve stable and dexterous object manipulation by coordinating grasp forces across multiple fingers and palms, facilitated by a unified tactile memory system in the somatosensory cortex. This system encodes and stores tactile experiences across skin regions, enabling the flexible reuse and transfer of touch information. Inspired by this biological capability, we present GenForce, the first framework that enables transferable force sensing across diverse tactile sensors in robotic hands. GenForce unifies tactile signals into shared marker representations, analogous to cortical sensory encoding, allowing force prediction models trained on one sensor to be transferred to others without the need for exhaustive force data collection. We demonstrate that GenForce generalizes across both homogeneous sensors with varying configurations and heterogeneous sensors with distinct sensing modalities and material properties. This transferable force sensing capability is also demonstrated in robot manipulation tasks including daily-object grasping, slip detection and compensation with multi-sensor force coordination. Our results highlight a scalable paradigm for cross-sensor robotic tactile sensing, offering new pathways toward adaptable and tactile memory-driven robot manipulation in unstructured environments.",

However, conventional organic polymeric resists inevitably entail the use of various chemical solutions or solvents, which especially compromise fragile electronic materials featuring atomic-level surfaces. Here, we introduce inorganic selenium molecules as a lithographic mediator for sensitive electronic material processing without direct exposure to solutions or solvents. Specifically, the inorganic selenium molecular film functions as both a lithographic mediator for direct patterning due to its weak intermolecular van der Waals interactions and as a protective encapsulation layer for atomic electronic materials without compromising structural and electronic characteristics. Wafer-scale arrays of sensitive materials with high-quality, sharp edges are facilely achieved by a non-destructive mechanical peeling of the selenium layer. This approach provides a solvent-free lithographic route for microfabricating sensitive materials and high-performance electronic devices.",

    "abstract": "The sense of touch is essential for safe interactions with the external world, enabling humans to rapidly detect and localize physical stimuli. Biological systems achieve these abilities through hundreds of thousands of mechanoreceptors distributed across the skin and efficiently processing vast streams of tactile information. Replicating these affordances in autonomous systems is crucial for advancing robotics. However, current tactile sensing solutions face critical challenges, including excessive wiring, high energy demnds of AI computing, and limitations in scalability and parallel processing. Here, we present a modular artificial tactile system combining a Fiber Bragg Grating-based e-skin with a spiking neural network (SNN) that mimics the early stages of the human somatosensory system. Our architecture achieves up to 10\u00d7 localization super-resolution, improving localization accuracy by 32% over state-of-the-art deep learning methods and effectively generalizing to multitouch and dynamic conditions. Crucially, when implemented on a neuromorphic chip, the SNN demonstrates robustness to the constrained resolution and mismatches of analog neurons, bolstering highly parallel and sub-mWatt hardwired computation. Bioinspired connectivity is shown to functionally influence tactile processing, offering mechanistic insights in a framework that bridges physiological hypotheses, modeling, and validation in a real-world tactile scenario. These results demonstrate a scalable, energetically sustainable solution for touch perception, with immediate applications in autonomous systems requiring safe human interaction and operation in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Dissolved phosphorus (P) is thought to limit the growth of glacier ice algae, which darken the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and enhance surface melt. This contention is largely based on the low-level of P concentrations, which are often below the limit of detection of conventional methods. Here, we propose that low-level nutrient analysis is essential to understand the macronutrient limitation of glacier algal growth on the GrIS. We sample surface (\u22645\u2009cm) and shallow (5-10 and ~80-90\u2009cm depth) ice from two sites in NW Greenland and measure the nano-molar concentrations of dissolved nitrogen (N) and P using a custom-built continuous segmented flow analyser. Quantifiable concentrations of these macronutrients are present, along with glacier ice algal abundances comparable to those of the Dark Zone, a zone of biologically enhanced ice sheet melting. Mass balance calculations for each site indicate that N and P released during seasonal ablation exceed the amounts incorporated into glacier ice algal biomass. These results suggest that dissolved macronutrients are unlikely to limit glacier ice algal growth on the Greenland Ice Sheet.",

Using the mdx mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, we developed innovative live imaging of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in vivo, and ex vivo on isolated myofibres. We show that mdx MuSCs have impaired migration and precocious differentiation through unbalanced symmetric divisions, driven by p38 and PI3K signalling pathways, in contrast to the p38-only dependence of healthy MuSCs. Cross-grafting shows that MuSC fate decisions are governed by fibre-independent cues, whereas their migration behaviour is determined by the myofibre niche. This study provides the first dynamic analysis of dystrophic MuSC properties in vivo, reconciling conflicting reports on their function. Our findings establish DMD as a MuSC disease with niche dysfunctions, offering strategies to restore stem cell functions for improved muscle regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia formation by tumor endothelial cells (TECs) is critical for tip cell-guided sprouting angiogenesis and tumor growth. However, the cytoskeletal organization that underlies this process remains elusive. Here, we demonstrates that TECs highly express actin-binding genes, with PDZ and LIM domain 5 (PDLIM5), a cytoskeletal protein, significantly upregulated in TECs and correlated with poor patient survival. Endothelial-specific deletion of Pdlim5 inhibits sprouting angiogenesis by disrupting filopodia formation through its interaction with actinin-1/actinin-4 (ACTN1/ACTN4) via its S593/F596 residues, promoting filamentous actin (F-actin) bundling. Pdlim5 knockout not only reduces tumor growth but also normalizes tumor vasculature, alleviates hypoxia, and enhances immunotherapy and chemotherapy responses. These findings highlight the PDLIM5's role in facilitating tumor angiogenesis via ACTN1/ACTN4-mediated F-actin bundling and tip cell filopodia formation, providing mechanistic insights that may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway.",

Herein, we report chemical recycling back to monomers for PMMA between 120-180\u00b0C, through UV illumination under oxygen-free conditions. We have achieved gram-scale degradation of consumer plastic with >95% conversion, yielding >70% monomer, which can be readily repolymerized. The process proceeds even at high concentrations (>1 M) and depends strongly on solvent choice: aromatic solvents like dichlorobenzene and diphenyl ether maximize conversion. In contrast to a concurrently published study, we report that chlorine radicals are not required for depolymerization; however, when present, they react with the unzipping chain to form chlorine-functionalized PMMA which can be upcycled through derivatization. In more sustainable non-chlorinated solvents such as benzonitrile, minimal termination by radicals enables complete unzipping. These findings demonstrate a low-temperature, scalable route for the chemical recycling of PMMA, offering alternative pathways for plastic circularity.",

To address this, we induced acute TCMR in mouse kidney transplants and profiled molecular changes using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence. Results were compared with human snRNA-seq data from TCMR and stable allografts, as well as single-cell deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptomic data from kidney transplant biopsies. Here we show that TCMR induces injured epithelial cell states in mouse kidney allografts, particularly in proximal tubules and thick ascending limbs. Spatial transcriptomics of these injured epithelial states demonstrated heterogeneous localization, interactions with immune cells and cellular microenvironments. Cross-species analysis confirmed similar severely injured epithelial states in human samples, whose abundances correlated with transplant survival and persisted despite TCMR resolution. Collectively, our results identify epithelial injury cell states as a determinant of outcome after TCMR.",

In female mice vaccinated with peptide-coated adenovirus-based vaccine PeptiCrad, training enhances glycolysis with creatine metabolism sustaining CXCL9/10 production, enabling macrophages to recruit NK cells via CXCR3. In turn, NK cells produce CCL5, driving cDC1 infiltration and antigen presentation, which together amplify effector memory CD8\u207a T cell responses. Moreover, with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CRC patient-derived organoids, trained macrophages boost NK migration, antigen-specific T cell activation, and tumor killing.

We present an integrated Multi-level PTMs-Proteomic Enrichment platform (MuPPE), enabling sequential glycoproteome, phosphoproteome, and proteome analysis from single biological samples.

MuPPE also enhances coverage, identifying more serum glycopeptides and brain phosphopeptides than other platforms. Applied to aging mouse cohorts, the platform uncovers tissue-specific PTMs remodeling and brain barrier dysfunction. For arsenic mechanisms of action, MuPPE reveals drug-induced PTMs crosstalk between glycosylation and phosphorylation-driven pathway regulation.

    "abstract": "Colorectal Cancer (CRC) progression is a complex and dynamic process closely linked to TET2-mediated DNA demethylation. Distinct from our previous study on TET2 nuclear loss, which can be observed in the whole tumor progression process, the nuclear increase of TET2 was only observed in tumors at the beginning of metastasis. In addition, cells with nuclear TET2 were located at the bottom of the mucosa, which is the invasion front of CRC. All of these results suggested crucial roles of TET2 nuclear increase during tumor progression. Mechanistically, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the activation of the WNT pathway, which is normally recognized as tumor promotion events, were shown to correlate with the cytoplasm-nucleus shuttling of TET2, which is associated with tumor suppression. Nuclear TET2, in turn, mitigated further EMT and WNT activation, suggesting a negative feedback loop between TET2 and the EMT/WNT pathway. Such a negative feedback loop was further supported by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of both the CRC progression models and the clinical CRC samples. Together, these findings indicate that the tumor inhibition role of EMT/WNT pathway and TET2 is an intrinsic brake on cancer progression, which represents a potential therapeutic target for CRC.",

    "abstract": "Droplet impacts are fundamental to fluid-structure interactions, shaping processes from erosion to bioprinting. While previous scaling laws have provided insights into droplet dynamics, force scaling laws remain insufficiently understood, particularly for soft substrates where both the droplet and substrate deform significantly. Here, we show that droplet impacts on elastic substrates exhibit a scaling crossover in maximum impact force, transitioning from inertial force scaling, typical for rigid substrates under high inertia, to Hertzian impact scaling, characteristic of rigid spheres on elastic substrates. Using high-speed photoelastic tomography, we captured high-resolution dynamic stress fields and identified a similarity parameter governing the interplay between droplet inertia, substrate elasticity, and deformation time scales. Our findings redefine how substrate properties influence impact forces, demonstrating that droplets under high inertia-long thought to follow inertial force scaling-can instead follow Hertzian impact scaling on soft substrates. This framework provides practical insights for designing soft, impact-resistant materials.",

    "title": "Targeting GNG4 inhibits tumor progression and restores enzalutamide sensitivity in prostate cancer by suppressing autophagy.",
    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent malignancy among men worldwide. Advanced prostate cancer is characterized by aggressive progression, limited therapeutic response, and poor prognosis. Elucidating its oncogenic mechanisms may provide new opportunities for targeted intervention. Increasing evidence suggests that modulating cytoprotective autophagy represents a promising strategy for improving cancer treatment efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. Here, we identified the G protein subunit GNG4 as a crucial regulator of prostate cancer development. GNG4 expression was markedly elevated in advanced prostate cancer phenotypes and positively correlated with tumor survival, apoptosis, and migration. Further analysis demonstrated that GNG4 depletion suppressed autophagy and enhanced cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide. Mechanistically, GNG4 interacts with GNB1 to stabilize the downstream effector protein GNAI3 through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. These three distinct G protein subunits form a functional complex that regulates intracellular autophagy and subsequently influences the malignant behavior of prostate cancer. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy or GNG4 knockdown significantly increased the antitumor efficacy of enzalutamide both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings identified GNG4 as a pivotal modulator of prostate cancer progression and proposed it as a promising therapeutic target to enhance the clinical response to enzalutamide. GNG4 interacts with GNB1 to stabilize GNAI3 via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway, thereby activating autophagy. This process promotes prostate cancer progression and resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSis). In contrast, GNG4 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of autophagy restores ARSI sensitivity and suppresses tumor growth.",

Little is known about the consequences of HIV on individuals' labor market outcomes. We study the impact of an HIV diagnosis using linked clinical data (the Dutch ATHENA cohort) and administrative data. A causal effect is estimated by comparing outcomes of people with HIV diagnosed between 2010 and 2022 (n\u2009=\u20095960) to a matched control group (n\u2009=\u200959,600) in a difference-in-difference design. We find that people with HIV are less likely to be employed, work fewer hours, earn less income, and are more likely to receive disability benefits up to 7 years after diagnosis. These effects are more pronounced for those diagnosed with late-stage HIV disease. Those with a non-late stage diagnosis experience a deterioration of socioeconomic outcomes, despite being less likely to experience clinically relevant symptoms at diagnosis. These findings highlight the need for continued efforts in prevention and early detection of HIV.",

Previous studies have been limited to a set of models with Ising-like couplings - and mostly only in one dimension - thus precluding our understanding of the existence (or not) of DTCs in models with more realistic interactions. In this work, by combining the latest generation of IBM quantum processors with state-of-the-art tensor network methods, we demonstrate the existence of a DTC in a two-dimensional system governed by anisotropic Heisenberg interactions. We uncover a rich phase diagram encompassing spin-glass, ergodic, and time-crystalline phases, and identify the interplay of initialization, interaction anisotropy, and driving protocols in stabilizing the DTC phase. By extending the study of Floquet matter beyond simplified models, we lay the groundwork for exploring how driven systems bridge the gap between quantum coherence and emergent non-equilibrium thermodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Trimethylation of the histone H3K36 residue (H3K36me3) plays an indispensable role in ensuring transcription fidelity by suppressing undesired cryptic transcription in chromatin. H3K36me3 modification is accomplished by Set2/SETD2 during transcription elongation by the RNA polymerase II elongation complex (EC). Here, we found that Set2-mediated H3K36me3 deposition occurs on the nucleosome reassembling behind the EC. The histone chaperone FACT suppresses H3K36me3 deposition on the downstream nucleosome, thereby ensuring that Set2 targets specifically on the reassembling upstream nucleosome. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the nucleosome-transcribing EC complexed with Set2 revealed that Set2 is anchored by the Spt6 subunit of the EC to capture both of the H3 N-terminal tails in a stepwise manner during the nucleosome reassembly process. Abrogation of the Set2-EC interaction leads to defective transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition. These insights elucidate the structure-based mechanism of transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition in chromatin.",

Under deep lower mantle conditions, water and hydrous phases transition into a superionic state. However, superionic effect on their stability and dehydration behavior remains unclear. Using ab initio and deep learning potential molecular dynamics simulations, we discovered a doubly superionic transition in \u03b4-AlOOH, characterized by the highly diffusive behavior of both hydrogen and aluminum ions within the oxygen sublattice. These highly diffusive elements contribute external entropy to the system, stabilizing the structure at 140 GPa and 3800 K. Our free-energy calculations reveal that water tends to freeze under deep lower mantle conditions, so dehydration becomes energetically and kinetically unfavorable even under core-mantle boundary (CMB) conditions. This implies that superionic water may accumulate in the deep lower mantle over geologic time, forming a long-term reservoir at the base of the mantle.",

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play diverse and critical roles in intercellular communication, and we have demonstrated interaction between EVs and vascular endothelial cells. Through serum proteomic analysis, we identified LIM and calponin homology domain-containing protein 1 (LIMCH1) as a PE-associated EV protein that is highly expressed in PE placentas, particularly in syncytiotrophoblasts, which release EVs into the maternal circulation. LIMCH1-enriched EVs (LIMCH1-EVs) increased endothelial permeability in vitro. Transcriptome analysis revealed that LIMCH1-EVs disrupted endothelial cell-cell junction assembly by suppressing the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1. Furthermore, administration of LIMCH1-EVs promoted pulmonary vascular permeability in vivo. These findings suggest a role of LIMCH1-EVs in EV-associated vascular endothelial dysfunction, a central pathology of PE. In addition, this study provides insights into mechanisms that may contribute to PE-associated pulmonary edema, which have not yet been clarified.",

Here, we introduce a universal statistical framework for targeted mode transport (TMT) that circumvents this limitation and validate it on various platforms including microwave networks, two-dimensional chaotic cavities, and three-dimensional reverberation chambers. TMT quantifies the efficiency of transferring energy between specified input and output channels in multimode wave-chaotic systems. We develop a diagrammatic theory that predicts the eigenvalue distribution of the TMT operator and identifies the macroscopic parameters-coupling strength, absorption, and channel control-that govern performance. The theory provides explicit bounds for optimal TMT wavefronts and captures phenomena like statistical transmission gaps and reflectionless states. These findings establish design principles for energy delivery and information transfer in complex environments, with broad implications for adaptive signal processing and wave-based technologies.",

In mice performing skilled locomotion, we recorded from dMSNs, iMSNs, and their cortical and thalamic inputs identified by monosynaptic rabies tracing. A recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier and clustering analysis revealed functionally heterogeneous subpopulations in each population, with dMSNs preferentially activated at movement onset and offset, and iMSNs during execution. Cortical and thalamic inputs were preferentially activated during onset/offset and execution, respectively, though dMSN- and iMSN-projecting neurons in each region showed similar patterns. Locomotion phase-specific rhythmic activity was found in a subset of thalamic dMSN-projecting neurons and dMSNs. Cortex or thalamus inactivation reduced MSN activity.

Here we propose a principle of hyperelastic and omniadhesive gels composed of polymer networks with long dangling chains and sufficient good solvents. The molecules of good solvents screen off interchain interactions for hyperelasticity. The long dangling chains disentangle and adsorb to substrate for strong adhesion. We synthesized such gels by controlling the polymerization kinetics. When a monomer solution is partially cured, some monomers form a network and others form the solvent. The resulting gel, termed homogel, consists of a polymer network with enormous dangling chains and solvent of identical chemistries. An interval exists where the dangling chains are long and disentangled substantially, and the homogel exhibits both hyperelasticity and omniadhesion. We demonstrated such a gel with a hysteresis of 4.1% (stretch\u00a0=\u00a010) and adhesion energy of ~510\u00a0joules per square meter. The principle is generic and applicable to gels of different types.",

    "title": "ML-automated microfluidic circuit design.",
    "abstract": "Microfluidics enable high-precision and cost-effective processing of biological and chemical substances. However, designing and fabricating microfluidic chips typically requires substantial expertise and numerous design iterations, posing considerable barriers to entry for nonexperts. We introduce \u03bcFluidicGenius (\u03bcFG), an open-access, machine learning (ML)-augmented design tool that enables nonexpert users to rapidly create functional microfluidic circuits. Users simply define the spatial placement of reservoirs, specify the channel connections between them, and assign desired flow rates through this layout. Leveraging a hybrid algorithmic framework that integrates ML models with mathematical modeling, \u03bcFG automatically generates spatially coded maze structures that implement the precise fluidic resistances needed to meet the target flow distribution. These resistive elements are optimized to fit within the available geometry and can reproduce complex flow profiles, such as physiologically relevant flow rates in multi-organ-on-chip platforms. The resulting microfluidic designs are directly exportable for three-dimensional printing. Experimental validation demonstrates that \u03bcFG-generated circuits reproduce target flow distributions with 90% accuracy. By streamlining and automating microfluidic circuit creation, \u03bcFG not only lowers the barrier to entry for nonexperts but also showcases a principled and efficient application of ML to fluidic system design, enabling rapid and customizable development of complex microfluidic architectures.",

    "title": "One-stop strabismus digital diagnosis via AI-integrated skin-like and wearable \"Eyelectronics\".",
    "abstract": "Strabismus, affecting ~4% of children, impairs vision and psychosocial health. However, clinical diagnosis requires multiple instruments and stepwise examinations of ocular alignment, extraocular muscle function, and deviation angle. It is limited by low diagnostic objectivity, poor pediatric compliance, and high cost. Here, we propose a strategy for one-stop strabismus digital diagnosis via artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated, skin-like, and wearable \"Eyelectronics.\" The ultralightweight, imperceptible eye-wearable system features an ultrathin (~60 micrometers in thickness), breathable, and multidirectional (0\u00b0/45\u00b0/90\u00b0) strain-sensing array conformally adapted to the sensitive eyelid. It enables wireless, mild-restricted measurement of eyelid deformation during eye movements. Through biomechanical modeling validated by ocular magnetic resonance imaging simulations, we establish a prior correlation between eyelid deformation and eye movements. The Eyelectronics, powered by our physiology knowledge-driven end-to-end AI algorithm, achieves simultaneous measurement of strabismus angle and identification of paretic muscle. It delivers a 96.6% four-direction classification accuracy and a 1.2\u00b0 measurement accuracy in ocular motility examinations. Clinical benchmarking against the clinical standard (Hess screen test) confirmed diagnostic agreement (intraclass correlation\u00a0=\u00a00.978). This system bridges quantitative biomechanical sensing with digital diagnosis, promoting a paradigm for future strabismus treatment.",

    "abstract": "Optical image processing techniques like edge detection demonstrate unique superiority in various applications. Synergistically combined with heralded quantum imaging, they have notable potential for identifying light-sensitive samples under minimal illumination. However, present schemes usually lack the capability to control the quantum imaging function dynamically. Here, we introduce versatile liquid crystals to realize heralded single-photon imaging and electrically tunable multimode switching. On the basis of the bichiral cholesteric liquid crystal modulator, different morphology information of the target can be extracted with a high signal-to-noise ratio, including the entire shape and its fine outline. The nematic liquid crystal, leveraging its electrically tunable properties, is explored to select specific polarizations of heralded single photons, enabling dynamic remote switching in trimode quantum imaging. To further improve the time efficiency, an ultrafast remote switching is presented on the basis of the appealing ferroelectric liquid crystals. This work supplies a unique imaging platform for photon-limited scenarios and reveals the unprecedented possibilities of soft matters in quantum information processing.",

To date, the reported effects of \u03b1Syn expression on the kinetics of axonal synaptic vesicle exocytosis and membrane cycling have been relatively small. In contrast, we report that \u03b1Syn is the major modulator of substantia nigra somatodendritic dopamine release, a little-understood form of neurotransmission that is central to sensorimotor and basal ganglia circuitry. This regulation is due to a previously unknown role for \u03b1Syn in controlling the activity of the L-type calcium ion channels (LTCC), which are also implicated in Parkinson's pathogenesis. \u03b1Syn-deficient neurons further display decreased spike frequency adaptation, hippocampal LTCC-dependent long-term potentiation, and immediate early gene induction, functions that are essential for synaptic adaptation and neuronal plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Surface-enhanced coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (SECARS) is believed to increase the signal intensity and sensitivity by combining the localized surface plasmon resonance and coherent Raman enhancement. However, the realization of SECARS is more complex than for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and remains challenging. Unlike SERS, the nonlinear CARS process requires the coherent interaction of three distinct fields. The interactions between the electric fields and nanoparticle (NP) morphology for single-particle SECARS remain unexplored, and the underlying mechanisms generating the SECARS signal are not fully understood. Here, 27 distinct NPs were synthesized and screened using a CARS microscope. Among them, only star-core core-satellite NPs show single-particle SECARS signals, which were affected by laser polarization, two-photon luminescence background, photoinduced heating effects, particle size, and particle morphology. The influence of NP properties on SECARS enhancement offers guidance for the design and synthesis of NPs for single-particle SECARS and opportunities in biological imaging and chemical sensing.",

    "abstract": "Predicting floating ice dynamics remains a challenging problem with implications for Earth's climate. While gigantic icebergs have garnered worldwide attention, small ice bodies have been overlooked, and we still lack their mechanistic models. Aided by a real-time tracking, we unravel the transient processes of freely floating ice in calm waters-including the kinematics, phase transition, and surrounding fluid dynamics-that govern melting. Combining the heat transfer model and our experimental results, we develop and validate a theoretical model for the melt rate, identifying ice geometry and convective regime as key controls. Furthermore, the ice-driven convective volume flux is found to exceed the meltwater flux by orders of magnitude, underscoring the ecological relevance of floating ice; it not only supplies freshwater but also acts as a destabilizing buoyancy source that redistributes mass macroscopically. Our study provides a foundation for developing mechanistic parameterizations of icebergs and ice floes melting in climate models.",

In nonhuman primates (NHPs), GW2580 crystals similarly protected viable, glucose-responsive allogeneic \u03b2 cells for 1 month without systemic immune suppression. In contrast, the same xenogeneic human SC-\u03b2 cell formulation that functioned long-term in mice elicited extensive sphere overgrowth and graft failure in NHPs.

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy is caused by hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin loss and characterized by cataplexy, a unique brain state triggered by emotion. Cataplexy shares features with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including muscle atonia and wake-like electroencephalographic activity. REM sleep is characterized by thermoregulatory suspension and, when the need for thermoregulatory responses is reduced as during ambient thermoneutral warming, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons play a critical role in favoring REM sleep expression. However, it remains unknown whether REM sleep and cataplexy share thermomodulatory mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that reduced skin temperatures and a widening of the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient precede cataplexy in both patients with narcolepsy and hypocretin-knockout (Hcrt-KO) narcoleptic mice. To test a causal role for skin temperature in cataplexy modulation, thermoneutral manipulation of skin temperature in Hcrt-KO mice revealed that skin cooling promoted cataplexy, whereas skin warming increased REM sleep. Fiber photometry showed that, at constant ambient temperatures (23\u00b0C), cataplexy and REM sleep were associated with increased MCH neuron activity. Skin cooling, however, reduced the MCH calcium imaging dynamics associated with cataplexy. Moreover, MCH optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulation recapitulated these effects, with MCH silencing favoring cataplexy and MCH activation driving REM sleep. Last, using the skin warming condition, we combined cFos staining and retrograde labeling and identified activated monosynaptic inputs from known thermoregulatory hubs such as the median preoptic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and the parabrachial nucleus to MCH neurons. These findings unveil an unexplored role for skin thermal dynamics and hypothalamic MCH thermosensitivity in dissociating cataplexy and REM sleep.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and nutrient availability, yet how tumor cells survive under lysosomal inhibition remains unclear. Here, we revealed that inhibiting lysosome function with chloroquine unexpectedly stimulated glucose uptake across various cancer cells. This effect was driven by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), a key lipogenic transcription factor, which specifically increased the expression of glucose transporters GLUT3 and GLUT6, enhancing glucose uptake and macromolecule synthesis. Elevated glucose, induced by chloroquine, stabilized SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), the activator of SREBP-1, further amplifying its activity and contributing to tumor resistance to lysosome inhibition. Disrupting this SREBP-1-glucose uptake feedforward loop by combining chloroquine with inhibitors of glucose transporters, SREBP-1, or lipogenic enzymes induced a synergistic antitumor effect in squamous cell and adenocarcinoma lung cancer patient-derived organoids and xenografts. This combination impaired mitochondrial structure and function, inducing apoptotic tumor cell death. Our study uncovers a role for SREBP-1 in regulating glucose metabolism and provides a promising therapeutic strategy that combines lysosome inhibition with glucose transporter or lipogenic enzyme inhibition for effective cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous and highly conserved programmed cell death pathways that are essential for tissue development and homeostasis are accompanied by distinct morphological alterations. Apoptotic cells undergo fragmentation that is concomitant with the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the membrane surface. Large fragments, called apoptotic bodies, as well as much smaller and more numerous vesicles are released. While the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptotic body formation have been explored, much less is known about vesicle biogenesis. We used an inducible, active form of TMEM16F to determine the role of lipid scrambling in vesiculation, separately from other apoptotic signaling events. Plasmalemmal lipid scrambling sufficed to release apoptotic-like vesicles without causing changes in cytosolic calcium or the submembrane cytoskeleton. The scrambled bilayer showed pronounced segregation of exofacial lipids and redistribution of detectable cholesterol to the inner leaflet. The clustering of raft-associated components with bulky headgroups-typified by glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins-formed domains of outward (convex) curvature, while regions of accumulation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) generated inward (concave) curvature that facilitated the scission of vesicles. Thus, scrambling of plasma membrane lipids suffices to induce regions of acute membrane curvature and facilitates detachment of vesicles analogous to those released from the surface of apoptotic cells.",

Rab5 GTPases are organelle identity markers on endosomes, though it remains unclear why cells have several Rab5 isoforms and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) as their activators. Using yeast, we demonstrate that the key Rab5 GEFs Vps9 and Muk1 overlap in their Rab5 specificity in vitro but cover distinct cellular territories in vivo. Vps9 functions between the Golgi and endosomes, while Muk1 is primarily found in the early endocytic pathway. Using targeting approaches, we show that Rab5 GEFs can only partially replace each other, demonstrating that each GEF is specific for its cellular niche. Intriguingly, Muk1 functions in vivo as an oligomer through its C-terminal domain, which is sufficient to also oligomerize a chimeric Vps9. Overall, our data suggest the spatial distribution of Rab5 GEFs and their substrate Rab5s fine-tune the endolysosomal system for cellular needs and metabolic cues.",

Engulfment starts at the apical surface, but LD's displace apical actomyosin to the basal cortex. However, actomyosin is activated and phagocytosis rescued when applying tissue-relevant compressive stress to LD-loaded macrophages. Macrophages that are densely filled with LD's or pre-engulfed beads likewise activate actomyosin which again rescues phagocytosis relative to sparsely loaded cells. LD's and rigid beads also impede macrophage migration through small pores, and LD's pressed strongly into a nucleus can even cause rapid focal rupture independent of actin. LD's thus disrupt cytoskeleton organization and nucleus integrity, generally suppressing motility processes unless actomyosin is activated by cell compression or stretching.",

    "abstract": "ZDHHC4, a palmitoyl transferase belonging to the DHHC family, is crucial in cells by catalyzing palmitoylation of proteins, thereby regulating their function and localization. However, its role in melanoma is not well understood. Here, our research determined that ZDHHC4 expression was upregulation in human melanoma specimens and cells. Functional studies reveal that knocking down ZDHHC4 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma cells. Moreover, we performed mass spectrometry analysis and found that ZEB-2 is a substrate of ZDHHC4. ZEB-2 interacted with ZDHHC4 through its N-terminal sequences, which promotes the ZDHHC4-mediated palmitoylation of ZEB-2 at C478, facilitating ZEB-2 deubiquitination and its protein stability. This key modification is required for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in melanoma cells. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the expression levels of ZDHHC4 and ZEB-2 in clinical melanoma samples. In summary, our results provide a deeper understanding of mechanism regulating ZDHHC4 in melanoma, suggesting that targeting ZDHHC4 may offer novel therapeutic strategies by suppressing tumor growth and metastasis through the disruption of ZEB-2 palmitoylation process.",

These results were similar when only considering DNMT3A and DNMT3A R882 clones.\nIn our cohorts, duration of metformin use among diabetic users was associated with a small reduction in CH growth rate (-0.06%/year), which is modest compared to typical DNMT3A clonal growth rates of 5-7% annually. Metformin's clinical utility for modulating clonal dynamics in real-world settings appear limited and its clinical use for this indication requires further investigation in prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent and metastatic human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HPV+ HNSCC) remains largely incurable, with genetic drivers incompletely defined. We profiled the genetic landscape of R/M HPV+ HNSCC, and functionally characterized genetic alterations strongly enriched in this cancer type.\nWe identified genetic alterations uniquely enriched in 159 R/M HPV+ tumors. High-priority alterations were functionally modeled, examining proliferation, clonogenicity, migration/invasion, apoptosis, therapy response, in vivo growth, and metastasis, and immune contexture.\nCompared with HPV+ primary tumors, R/M HPV+ tumors were enriched for TP53 mutations (pre-specified FDR threshold met; OR 6.23; p=.02) and associated with poorer survival. Within R/M disease, CYLD alterations were specific to HPV+ tumors (21% vs 0% in HPV-). TP53 mutations were predominantly clonal and associated with whole genome duplication. Expression of TP53 GOF mutants (R175H, G245C, R273C) in HPV+ HNSCC cells increased clonogenic survival, migration/invasion, lung metastatic burden in vivo, and cisplatin IC50, without altering radiation sensitivity. CYLD knockdown accelerated cellular growth yet increased radiosensitivity. Transcriptomic analyses linked CYLD loss to NF-\u03baB/TNF-\u03b1 pathway activation, a T-cell-inflamed microenvironment, and checkpoint upregulation.\nR/M HPV+ HNSCC is genomically and functionally shaped by 2 axes with therapeutic implications: TP53 gain-of-function mutations promote metastatic phenotypes and cisplatin resistance, while CYLD loss defines an HPV-specific subset with enhanced radiation sensitivity and immune activation. These data support using TP53 and CYLD as predictive biomarkers to guide investigation into precision strategies for systemic therapy choices, p53-targeted/Wee1 strategies, and radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in high-risk or R/M HPV+ HNSCC.",

    "abstract": "This multicenter, phase IIa trial (NCT04868162) investigated the efficacy and safety of becotatug vedotin, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have limited therapeutic options.\nPatients with R/M SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, including those with multiple lines of prior therapy, were administered intravenous becotatug vedotin at either 2.0 or 2.3 mg/kg every three weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR).\nSixty-seven patients were enrolled (35 received 2.0 mg/kg and 32 received 2.3 mg/kg). The ORR was 20.9% (14/67, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-32.6), with a median duration of response of 10.9 months (95% CI, 2.6-15.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.9), and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.9). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91.0% (61/67) patients, most commonly being rash (26.9%), pruritus (25.4%), constipation (23.9%), and anemia (20.9%).\nBecotatug vedotin demonstrated promising antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in previously heavilytreated R/M SCCHN, particularly the recommended dose of 2.3 mg/kg in patients who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (\u22642 prior lines of therapy).",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue consisting of fibers with distinct contractile speeds, metabolic profiles, and cellular signaling. This heterogeneity may extend to mitochondrial quality control processes such as mitophagy. Using mt-Keima mice, we found that mitophagic activity was greater in the fast-twitch, glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) compared to the slow-twitch, oxidative soleus (SOL) muscle. Live imaging of quadriceps (QUAD) muscle revealed two distinct fiber populations: those with high total mt-Keima signal but low mitophagic activity, and others with low signal but higher mitophagic activity. Additionally, we observed skeletal muscle type and regional differences in autophagic and mitophagic protein content. Further, select mitophagic proteins strongly correlated with mitochondrial proteins across different regions of the gastrocnemius, while others did not. These findings highlight the complexity of mitophagy regulation in skeletal muscle and emphasize the importance of considering muscle phenotype, including fiber type, region, and mitochondrial content when studying mitophagy.",

    "abstract": "The ability to learn and form memories is critical for animals to make choices that promote their survival. The biological processes underlying learning and memory are mediated by a variety of genes in the nervous system, acting at specific times during memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Many studies have utilised candidate gene approaches or random mutagenesis screens in model animals to explore the key molecular drivers for learning and memory. We propose a complementary approach to identify this network of learning regulators: the proximity-labelling tool TurboID, which promiscuously biotinylates neighbouring proteins, to snapshot the proteomic profile of neurons during learning. To do this, we expressed the TurboID enzyme in the entire nervous system of ",

    "title": "Global risk mapping of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and H5Nx in the light of epidemic episodes occurring from 2020 onwards.",
    "abstract": "Avian influenza (AI) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting poultry and wild water birds, posing significant global challenges due to its high mortality rates and economic impacts. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, particularly those caused by H5N1 and its variants, have surged since 1959. The HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have notably expanded their geographical reach, affecting numerous countries, diverse avian species, and now mammals. Using an ecological niche modelling approach, this study aims to elucidate the environmental factors associated with increased HPAI H5 cases since 2020, investigate potential shifts in ecological niches, and predict new areas suitable for viral circulation. We developed ecological niche models for HPAI cases in wild and domestic birds across two distinct periods: 2015-2020 and 2020-2022. Key environmental predictors include chicken and duck population density, human density, distance to water bodies, and land cover variables. Post-2020, we observe increased relative influence of predictors such as intensive chicken population density and cultivated vegetation. Risk maps reveal notable ecological suitability for HPAI H5 circulation in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, with significant expansions of at-risk areas post-2020. Wild bird H5 occurrences appear primarily correlated with urban areas and open water regions. Our analyses also highlight a potential shift in affected wild bird species diversity, with more avian species, particularly sea birds, impacted post-2020. Overall, these results further contribute to the understanding of HPAI epidemiology and identify regions where surveillance and control measures should be prioritised.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically detected too late for useful therapeutic interventions; hence, we sought blood biomarkers to detect early-stage disease.\nUsing mass spectrometry and ELISA on plasma pools from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the Mayo Clinic (Mayo), we identified aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) as increased in early-stage (stage I/II) PDAC plasma compared with controls. We tested ANPEP and PIGR, along with prior data for thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), in retrospective phase II studies using separate cohorts of PDAC plasmas at different stages versus healthy or nonmalignant disease controls (DC) from Penn (n = 135) and Mayo (n = 537).\nComparing healthy controls with stage I/II PDAC, we obtained area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.68-0.86]/0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.85; ANPEP) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-0.88)/0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.90; PIGR) for the Penn/Mayo phase II studies, respectively. In multivariable models, CA19-9/THBS2/ANPEP, CA19-9/THBS2/PIGR, and CA19-9/THBS2/ANPEP/PIGR elicited AUC of 0.94 to 0.96 for Penn and 0.97 for Mayo. Notably, the four-marker panel elicited AUC of 0.87 for the Mayo stage I/II versus DC and 0.91 for stages I to IV versus DC. At a specificity of 95%, a plasma biomarker panel composed of CA19-9 (\u226535 U/mL), THBS2 (\u226542 ng/mL), ANPEP (\u22652,995 ng/mL), and PIGR (\u22651,800 ng/mL) yielded a sensitivity of 91.9% for PDAC stages I to IV and 87.5% for PDAC stage I/II.\nAdding ANPEP and PIGR to a plasma biomarker panel of CA19-9 and THBS2 enhances the detection of early-stage PDAC when comparing cancer versus healthy or nonmalignant DC. Given the concordance of our data in two retrospective phase II studies, assessments in prediagnostic cases are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (calves) transdifferentiated from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a critical determinant of liver metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms behind transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-stimulated activation of HSCs into calves remain poorly understood. Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry identified tuftelin 1 (TUFT1) as a novel TGF-\u03b2 receptor II (T\u03b2RII) binding protein in primary human HSCs and immortalized LX2 cells. TUFT1 interacts with T\u03b2RII via its fragments (amino acids 1-86, 87-157), protecting T\u03b2RII from lysosomal degradation to facilitate TGF-\u03b2 signaling and myofibroblastic activation of HSCs. Mechanistically, TUFT1 competes with caveolin-1 for T\u03b2RII binding, retrieving T\u03b2RII from the lipid rafts/caveolae-mediated degradation pathway and sorting it into the endosome-mediated trafficking and signaling pathway. Clinically, TUFT1 expression was confirmed in the calves of patient-derived colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) tissues. Both protein and transcript analyses revealed higher TUFT1 expression in the calves of CRCLM than in HSCs. Furthermore, bulk RNA sequencing indicated that knocking down TUFT1 altered the TGF-\u03b2 transcriptome of HSCs and suppressed HSC expression of tumor-promoting factors. In HSC/CRC co-implantation and portal vein tumor injection mouse models, targeting TUFT1 of HSCs inhibited HSC activation and restricted CRC growth in both subcutaneous and hepatic sites. Taken together, our findings uncover the novel function of TUFT1 in the hepatic tumor microenvironment, highlighting its role as a critical regulator of HSC activation and the pro-metastatic hepatic niche via promoting T\u03b2RII protein stability. Targeting TUFT1 in HSCs presents a promising therapeutic approach for combating CRCLM.",

    "abstract": "Time-dependent spatial modulation of a quantum condensate plays a key role in the investigation of the dynamics of collective coherent systems. Cold-atom condensates were already manipulated into forming solitons, vortices and optical lattices via the dynamic Stark effect. In the solid-state framework, semiconductor microcavity exciton-polaritons present an excellent platform for observing nonequilibrium condensate dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic manipulation of exciton-polariton condensates offers numerous potential implementations in all-optical logic devices. We report the first observation of the energy modulation of an exciton-polariton condensate via the dynamic Stark effect. A Stark pulse is employed to induce a transient, coherence-preserving blueshift in the energy of the condensate of femtosecond-scale duration. A novel approach is presented for discerning the Stark effect in a condensate from the uncondensed case according to distinctive features in differential reflectance spectra, including spectro-temporal oscillations enabling to detect the buildup of coherence. The ultrafast and non-invasive modulation of the exciton-polariton condensate demonstrated here opens new research avenues of nonequilibrium physics of solid-state condensates as well as opportunities for polariton-based elements in both classical and quantum information technologies.",

    "abstract": "Representing the will of voters is challenging when many opt out of indicating their preferences. Such opt-out\u00a0behavior has been explained by voters lacking a preference and/or disliking their options. We provide evidence for a third account: people opt out of choosing between undesirable candidates because bad options are incongruent with their typical goal of selecting the best one. Using a voting task, we show across two lab-based studies that the tendency to opt out of choices between bad candidates is eliminated when participants are asked to reject the worst candidate. Leveraging our experimental findings, we simulate elections and show that rejection-based voting can produce election outcomes that are more representative of the preferences of the electorate. To validate this prediction, we conduct two Prolific surveys of self-reported US Independents before the 2024 US presidential election, and show that people are less likely to respond \"undecided\" when asked who they will vote against rather than who they will vote for. Our findings help understand when and how people vote, and how to better reveal the preferences of voters who know which candidates they like least but are unwilling to endorse the one they like most.",
