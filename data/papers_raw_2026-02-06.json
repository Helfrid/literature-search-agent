    "abstract": "Within the nucleus of each human cell, \u223c2\u00a0m of linear DNA is compacted and organized. The structures and principles of genome organization are developmentally regulated and broadly evolutionarily conserved. However, conclusive links between genome structure and function have been difficult to find. In this Review, we provide an overview of mammalian genome organization, highlight recent studies demonstrating how it interacts with evolutionary diversity, and explore its contributions to development. We propose an innovative perspective - that variability in genome organization supports plastic cell fates in multicellular organisms - and draw analogies to show how evolutionary variation can inform study of the function of genome organization.",

    "abstract": "The retrovirus-derived Rtl1 gene is integral to skeletal muscle development. However, the underlying mechanisms and functional roles of Rtl1 in skeletal muscle growth remain unclear.\nWe generated conditional overexpression of Rtl1 in mice via synonymous mutations that silence seven miRNA target sites, thereby efficiently abolishing miRNA-mediated inhibition in vivo. This conditional, specific overexpression of synonymous mutated Rtl1 (mRtl1) in the diaphragm muscles of mice foetuses resulted in aberrant embryonic diaphragm muscle development, adversely affecting both diaphragmatic and pulmonary development. This modification ultimately culminated in severe respiratory distress, leading to postnatal mortality. Subsequently, the conditional overexpression of mRtl1 in the tibialis anterior muscle of adult mice resulted in inflammation and hypertrophy. Furthermore, the overexpression of mRtl1 in cultured myotubes activated the TLR7/8-NF\u03baB and Jak-STAT3 signalling pathways, resulting in hypertrophy and inflammation.\nThese findings suggest that the overexpression of Rtl1 may contribute to skeletal muscle hypertrophy and induce inflammation in murine models. Consequently, the precise regulation of Rtl1 expression is essential for maintaining skeletal muscle function.",

Proteins like Fused in sarcoma (FUS) and Tar DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulate and aggregate in the cytosol of neurons in ALSO/FTD. Yet, it remains unclear how ageing affects FUS and TDP-43 aggregation, and how these aggregates in turn influence neurodegeneration in ALSO/FTD. In addition, mistranslation can reduce longevity, challenge proteostasis, and modulate protein aggregation. To investigate how ageing and mistranslation modulate FUS and TDP-43 aggregation and toxicity, we enlist tractable and reliable yeast models.\nUsing optimized low-expression FUS and TDP-43 yeast models, we demonstrate that chronological ageing antagonizes proteostasis, the steady state levels and solubility of molecular chaperones, and aggregation of FUS and TDP-43. In addition, mistranslation caused by tRNA variants further antagonize FUS and TDP-43 aggregation and synergize to exacerbate FUS and TDP-43 cytotoxicity.\nOur work provides new insights into factors that uncouple FUS and TDP-43 aggregation from toxicity and support a rather protective role for FUS and TDP-43 aggregates in promoting longevity.",

We present a multifunctional optoacoustically augmented magnetic guidewire (OptoMaG) that integrates optoacoustic imaging with magnetic navigation to enable radiation-free, image-guided interventions. The ~250-micrometer flexible guidewire incorporates a 460-nanometer luminescent core with an enhanced optoacoustic signature and a FePt magnetic tip for precise, steerable control. Proof-of-concept studies show that OptoMaG can be actively navigated with external magnetic fields to traverse a 3D human-scale cerebrovascular phantom and accurately reach target brain sites. Beyond navigation, the FePt tip enables localized thermal ablation under remote radiofrequency stimulation, highlighting its theranostic potential for tumor treatment. In addition, OptoMaG functions as a light source for photodynamic therapy, selectively activating photosensitizers to destroy tumor cells while preserving healthy tissue. Collectively, OptoMaG provides a safe, radiation-free platform merging real-time navigation with targeted therapeutic capabilities.",

This study combines school zone shapefiles with census and Civil Rights Database data to explore whether neighborhood racial change in Black populations predicts changes in Black-white school suspension disparities from 2010 to 2018. We find that racial disparities in suspensions increased, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing substantial shifts in Black populations. These increases were especially pronounced in suburban and rural areas with shifting Black populations and all predominantly White neighborhoods. Although school discipline reforms aimed to reduce racial disparities, they only declined in certain types of neighborhoods, most notably in urban areas.

We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of [Formula: see text]. This result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a nonzero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on nonzero initial velocities.

However, indefinite passaging of HuNoVs in HIEs remained a challenge, necessitating the use of patient stool samples as viral inocula. Using RNA-seq, we identified CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5 as up-regulated chemokines, suggesting their potential as host restriction factors. TAK-779, a CXCR3/CCR5/CCR2 antagonist, enhanced GII.3 HuNoV replication and viral spread in a dose- and time-dependent manner, enabling successful passaging of GII.3 HuNoV in two different HIE lines and generation of viral stocks. Sequencing passaged virus revealed one consensus change in the major capsid protein and several dynamic adaptations, suggesting emergence of variants. TAK-779 also enhanced replication of GI.1 and GII.17 strains, but not GII.4, suggesting strain-specific host interactions. This breakthrough in passaging provides insight into HuNoV-host interactions, establishes a scalable in vitro system for virus propagation, and opens avenues for structural, biochemical, and therapeutic studies.",

    "title": "Oriented cell divisions induce basal progenitors and regulate neural expansion across tissues and species.",
    "abstract": "Nervous system expansion relies on progenitor proliferation, yet its regional and evolutionary regulation is incompletely understood. While basally dividing progenitors are implicated in neocortical growth, their developmental origins and relevance beyond the cortex remain unclear. We show here that double inactivation of spindle orientation regulators GPSM2 and SAPCD2 in mice completely reorients progenitor divisions in both the neocortex and retina. This shift increases basal progenitors over sixfold in the neocortex and induces their ectopic emergence in the retina, resulting in extra cell layers and\u00a0~30% tissue enlargement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the induced basal progenitors in the cortex resemble human outer radial glia, and both cortical and retinal progenitors show altered Hippo signaling. Last, macaque and human retinas display twice as many reoriented divisions as the mouse and naturally contain basal progenitors. These findings show that division orientation is critical for regulating neural progenitor output and scaling tissue growth.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic animals such as octopuses use soft suction cups to solve the persistent challenge of wet attachment on rough surfaces. Detachment has long been described as smooth drainage governed by a Reynolds-type pressure gradient. Combining spatiotemporal pressure mapping with confocal imaging of the fluid layer between a suction cup-substrate interface, we reveal a two-stage, nonequilibrium pathway for pressure equalization that challenges this conventional view. Suction-induced elastic deformation dynamically remodels the interfacial fluid, producing a self-coupled pressure channel system. Stage I is governed by an outward-moving invasion-percolation suction front with diffusion-like scaling. When internal suction falls below a critical value, the network opens globally, and stage II follows classical Poiseuille drainage. This mechanism defines a self-modifying percolation in which the flow remodels its own pathways, which advances our understanding of biological suction and viscous adhesion and suggests design principles for long-lived wet adhesives and hydrogel microfluidics.",

    "abstract": "The radiometric ages of the returned samples are the cornerstone of lunar cratering chronology models. However, all the previous samples were from the lunar nearside and the radiometric ages of those samples that can be associated with particular surfaces are <4.0 billion years. On 25 June 2024, Chang'e-6 successfully returned 1.935-kilogram samples from the lunar farside. The samples included local basalts with an age of 2807\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 million years and the norites with an age of 4247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 million years likely corresponding to the age of the South Pole-Aitken basin. With these radiometric ages, we refined the lunar chronology function (CF) and verified that it is still consistent with a combination of an exponential decrease and a linear rate. We further derived the impacting rate and found it supports a smooth decay instead of abrupt changes of the impactor flux at early times. The refined lunar CF can be used to obtain more reliable ages for unsampled lunar areas and provide critical constraint for the lunar early impact history.",

However, the relatively low output voltage of aqueous systems continues to limit their achievable energy density. The aqueous electrolyte occupies a central role in addressing this limitation because it mediates ion transport and interfacial reactions at both the cathode and anode; accordingly, advances in electrolyte design are indispensable to meet future performance demands. In this review, we elucidate the core bottlenecks in aqueous electrolyte design, distill molecular-level design principles, and outline feasible pathways for future practical implementation. We aim to guide the development of next-generation aqueous electrolytes that harmonize outstanding electrochemical performance, thereby accelerating the transition from laboratory concepts to transformative energy solutions.",

However, the mechanisms by which electrical signals are generated, sensed, and transmitted upon damage to promote organ growth remain unclear. Here, we uncover that organ repair relies on dynamic electrochemical coupling between membrane potential depolarization and intracellular signaling, essential to activate cell proliferation. By subsecond live imaging of locally injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across time and space: a millisecond, long-range, membrane depolarization gradient, followed by second-persistent intracellular calcium responses. In the subsequent hour, voltage sensing phosphatase senses the injury-driven membrane potential change and autonomously translates the electric signal intracellularly, promoting tissue-wide cell proliferation. Connecting these dynamics with an electrodiffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin's interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading. Our work reveals the coupling between fast electrical signals and slower intracellular signaling, ensuring complete organ recovery.",

Here we incorporate realistic volcanic forcing into a large ensemble of glacial era-coupled atmosphere-ocean model simulations. These simulations are constrained by sulfate records from ice cores, which help estimate the timing of past major eruptions. We investigate how volcanic eruptions may have occasionally triggered abrupt climate change during the last glacial period. Our results show that very large equatorial eruptions can induce large changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation via atmospheric and ocean circulation changes and air-sea buoyancy fluxes, potentially pushing the climate system between persistent warm and cold states lasting millennia. A simplified perspective of the dynamics shows how unforced natural climate variability may exert a stabilizing influence decades after an eruption, especially as the system nears a tipping point.",

Fast-sinking marine snow particles, such as diatom aggregates, encounter a rapid increase in hydrostatic pressure during their descent. Using incubations in rotating pressure tanks, we found that pressure levels corresponding to 2- to 6-kilometer water depth induce leakage of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from diatom aggregates equivalent to ~50% of their initial carbon contents. The leaked DOM proved to be diatom-derived and changed the amount and composition of DOM in the surrounding seawater substantially. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, high protein-like fluorescence, and low carbon:nitrogen ratios classified the leaked DOM as labile. The bioavailability of leaked DOM was demonstrated by its rapid utilization by a pelagic microbial community, leaving mainly recalcitrant DOM behind. Pressure-induced DOM leakage likely weakens the gravitational \"biological carbon pump\" and supplies labile DOM to the pelagic microbiome of the deep ocean.",

Here, we identify a dual-functional ensemble within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that modulates both anxiety-like behaviors and insomnia through distinct neural circuits. Specifically, a subset of BNST neurons exhibits enhanced activity in response to anxiety-related cues and during wakefulness. Activation of these ensemble neurons exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors and reduces non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice. Conversely, inactivation of these neurons alleviates anxiety-like behaviors and promotes NREM sleep. In addition, anxiolytic-hypnotic medication attenuates BNST stress ensemble hyperactivity, mitigating both phenotypes. Furthermore, BNST stress ensembles project divergently to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the preoptic area (POA): DRN-projecting neurons selectively modulated anxiety, whereas POA-projecting neurons specifically regulated sleep-wake states. These findings suggest that hyperactive BNST stress ensembles are responsible for inducing anxiety-like behaviors and disrupting sleep in CRS mice and achieve the modality specificity through their divergent downstream targets.",

To address such limitation, we propose a line scanning-based photoacoustic computed mesoscopic (PACMes) approach for noninvasive, high-resolution, and longitudinal visualization of cerebral vasculature inside the intact mouse brain. This technique uses converging near-infrared (NIR) lines scanned at multiple angles for tight optical excitation; a low-frequency, full-ring ultrasound transducer array for high-sensitivity detection; and a compound reconstruction algorithm integrating filtered back-projection and optical localization of photoacoustic signals to recover the image. We perform long-term (>5 months), noninvasive imaging of the entire cortex of mice through the intact scalp and skull with a field of view of 13 millimeters and a spatial resolution of 33 micrometers.

We performed longitudinal genomic analysis of 755 samples from 167 patients with colorectal-derived neoplasias from different stages through metastasis and treatment. Adenomas had few copy number alterations (CAN) and most were subclonal, whereas cancers had many clonal CNAs, suggesting that progression goes through a CAN bottleneck. Individual colorectal cancer glands from the same tumor had similar karyotypes, despite evidence of ongoing instability at the cell level. CNAs in metastatic lesions, after therapy, and in late recurrences were similar to the primary. Mathematical modeling indicated that these data are consistent with the action of negative selection on CNAs that \"trap\" cancer genomes on a fitness peak characterized by specific CNAs. Hence, progression to colorectal cancer requires traversing a rugged fitness landscape, whereas subsequent CAN evolution is constrained by negative selection.\nWe profiled 167 long-term responders longitudinally (755 samples), documenting long-term cancer evolution. We found that a genetic bottleneck is required for progression and is associated with dramatic increase in CNAs but decrease in clonal diversity. After initiation, copy number evolution is constrained by negative selection through metastasis and treatment. See related commentary by Okada et al., p. 192.",

    "title": "Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Resistance via Loss of HER2 Expression and Binding.",
    "abstract": "Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) is clinically beneficial in HER2-positive and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. However, therapeutic resistance emerges over time in most patients, with poorly defined resistance mechanisms. Through a molecular characterization of paired patient specimens before and after T-DXd treatment, we found that 49% cases had major decreases in HER2 expression at progression, and among them, 52% exhibited complete HER2 loss. Using isogenic model systems, we demonstrated that decreases in HER2 expression corresponded to reductions in T-DXd internalization and major increases in drug IC50 value for tumor growth inhibition. We further identified and validated ERBB2 mutations in the trastuzumab binding interface (V597M and P593R) that promoted T-DXd resistance. As a strategy to overcome impaired T-DXd binding and internalization, we tested low-dose combinations of T-DXd with TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and found that these could more uniformly deliver DXd payloads and thereby overcome resistance mediated by HER2 loss.\nThe mechanisms underlying clinical T-DXd resistance have not been established. We now report on two mechanisms of resistance that converge on loss of target binding and propose combinations of distinct ADCs with shared payloads as a strategy to overcome resistance by enhancing intratumor delivery.

    "title": "A Plastic EMP1+ to LGR5+ Cell State Conversion as a Bypass to KRASG12D Pharmacologic Inhibition in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Inhibitors of the oncogene KRAS hold promise for treating metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In this study, we show that a selective, covalent small-molecule inhibitor of the active (ON) conformation of RAS-G12D, RMC-9945, exerts durable disease control in preclinical colorectal cancer models of early liver metastasis, but its therapeutic activity was diminished in the advanced metastatic disease. RMC-9945-treated metastases underwent a transition from a poor prognosis-associated Emp1+ transcriptional state to a WNT-driven Lgr5+ stem cell-like state that withstands the absence of RAS-G12D activity. This cell state change occurred within hours of RAS(ON) inhibitor treatment through a shift in transcription factor usage that involved limited chromatin remodeling. Forced conversion of metastatic cells to the Lgr5+ state through RAS-G12D inhibition, followed by genetic ablation of this population, reduced metastatic burden and prolonged survival in a mouse mCRC model. Overall, these preclinical findings demonstrate a central role for oncogenic KRAS in governing cellular plasticity in mCRC.\nWe show that inhibition of oncogenic KRAS in preclinical models of advanced mCRC exerts a limited benefit, primarily due to the reversion of tumor cells to a stem cell-like state. Our findings highlight the context-dependent effects of oncogenic KRAS mutations and underscore cell plasticity as a therapeutic opportunity.

    "title": "p53 Drives Lung Cancer Regression through a TSC2/TFEB-dependent Senescence Program.",
    "abstract": "Pharmacologic restoration of p53 tumor suppressor function is a conceptually appealing therapeutic strategy for the many deadly cancers with compromised p53 activity, including lung adenocarcinoma. However, the p53 pathway has remained undruggable, partly because of insufficient understanding of how to drive effective therapeutic responses without toxicity. In this study, we use mouse and human models to deconstruct the transcriptional programs and sequelae underlying robust therapeutic responses in lung adenocarcinoma. We show that p53 drives potent tumor regression by direct Tsc2 transactivation, leading to mTORC1 inhibition and Transcription factor EB (TFEB) nuclear accumulation, which in turn triggers lysosomal gene expression programs, autophagy, and cellular senescence. Senescent lung adenocarcinoma cells secrete factors to recruit macrophages, precipitating cancer cell phagocytosis and tumor regression. Collectively, our analyses reveal a surprisingly complex cascade of events underlying a p53 therapeutic response in lung adenocarcinoma and illuminate targetable nodes for p53 combination therapies, thus establishing a critical framework for optimizing p53-based therapeutics.\nCancer therapies based on targeting the p53 pathway remain elusive. To address this gap, we unravel the detailed sequence of events governing p53-induced tumor regression in lung adenocarcinoma. These analyses reveal a TSC2-mTORC1-TFEB axis underlying p53-driven senescence and tumor regression, which suggests new strategies to perfect p53-based combination therapies for lung adenocarcinoma.",

    "title": "Glucocorticoids Unleash Immune-dependent Melanoma Control through Inhibition of the GARP/TGF\u03b2 Axis.",
    "abstract": "Half of patients with advanced melanoma fail to benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, and novel treatments are urgently required. Testing topical medications for anticancer activity in an immunotherapy-resistant murine melanoma model, we found that, counterintuitively, glucocorticoids (GCs) elicit rapid cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-dependent tumor control. Genetic ablation of the GC receptor in different cellular compartments revealed that GCs acted not on immune cells but directly on tumor cells to downregulate the expression of glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP). This inhibited TGF\u03b2 signaling and unleashed CTL killing. In agreement, GCs stimulated tumor control in multiple cancer models but only if the tumors also responded to pharmacologic inhibition of TGF\u03b2 signaling. Furthermore, patients with melanoma with high GC receptor expression or signaling showed improved prognosis and lower TGF\u03b2 signaling in tumor-infiltrating CTLs. Additionally, elevated GARP expression correlated with reduced survival, including in immunotherapy-treated patients. Thus, the GARP/TGF\u03b2 axis emerges as a GC-sensitive cancer cell-intrinsic immune-evasive mechanism.\nThis study uncovers a surprising role for GCs in triggering CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor control through downregulation of GARP and thus TGF\u03b2 signaling. Analysis of samples from patients with melanoma suggested that GARP expression may serve as both a biomarker of poor antitumor immunity and a therapeutic target to improve the response to immunotherapy.

    "title": "Screening for Tumor Microtube-Targeting Drugs Identifies PKC Modulators as Multipotent Inhibitors of Glioblastoma Progression.",
    "abstract": "Glioblastomas are incurable primary brain tumors that depend on neural-like cellular processes, tumor microtubes (TM), to invade the brain. TMs also interconnect single tumor cells to a communicating multicellular network that resists current therapies. In this study, we developed a combined, comprehensive in vitro/in vivo anti-TM drug screening approach, including machine learning-based analysis tools. Two protein kinase C (PKC) modulators robustly inhibited TM formation and pacemaker tumor cell-driven, TM-mediated glioblastoma cell network communication. As TM-unconnected tumor cells exhibited increased sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy, the PKC activator TPPB was combined with radiotherapy, and long-term intravital two-photon microscopy paired with spatially resolved multiomics revealed anti-TM and antitumor effects. TPPB treatment also decreased the expression of tweety family member 1 (TTYH1), a key driver of invasive TMs. Our study establishes a novel screening pipeline for anti-TM drug development, identifies a TM master regulator pathway, and supports the approach of TM targeting for efficient brain tumor therapies.\nCancers can hijack neural properties to grow, disseminate, and to resist therapies, but effective drug development pipelines against these features are missing. Here, we establish a compound screening approach that allowed the identification of PKC modulators that target cancer cell-intrinsic neurodevelopmental mechanisms, suggesting a new class of neuroscience-instructed cancer therapeutics.",

    "title": "Recurrent Immunogenic Neoantigens and Their Cognate T-cell Receptors in Treatment-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer.",
    "abstract": "New approaches that generate long-lasting therapeutic responses in patients with therapy-resistant metastatic cancer are urgently needed. To address this challenge, we developed Spot Neoantigens in Metastases (SpotNeoMet), a novel data-driven pipeline that systematically identifies recurrently presented neopeptides in treatment-resistant patients. We identified seven therapy resistance mutations predicted to produce neopeptides presented by common HLAs. Using HLA immunopeptidomics, we discovered three novel neopeptides derived from androgen receptor (AR) H875Y, a common metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) mutation. We validated these neoantigens as highly immunogenic and then isolated and characterized cognate T-cell receptors (TCR) from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrated that AR H875Y-specific TCRs are highly specific and kill prostate cancer cells presenting AR neopeptides in vitro and in vivo. Our new pipeline identifies novel immunotherapy targets and potential treatment options for patients with mCRPC. Moreover, SpotNeoMet offers a systematic route to identify \"HLA-peptide\" pairs and their cognate TCRs across treatment-resistant cancers.\nAs the emergence of resistance to targeted treatments in patients with metastatic cancer, there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches for this population. Our study provides a new analytic framework to identify neoantigens from treatment-resistant mutations and a proof-of-concept T cell-based immunotherapy treatment for mCRPC.",

    "title": "Epigenetic and Transcriptional Programs Define Osteosarcoma Subtypes and Establish Targetable Vulnerabilities.",
    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is a genomically complex tumor characterized by widespread structural rearrangements. This complexity has limited the development of therapeutic strategies informed by molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis. We hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms could drive distinct subtypes of osteosarcoma. Through analysis of chromatin accessibility, we identified an \"early osteoblast-derived\" cell state, characterized by upregulation of transcription factors associated with early bone development, and a \"late osteoblast-derived\" state, characterized by upregulation of genes involved in late bone development. We then defined core regulatory circuitries governing the underlying gene expression programs in these two cell states. Multiomic single-cell analysis indicates that these cell states coexist in a single tumor. Finally, using a panel of patient-derived xenograft models, we identified differential drug responses dependent on these cellular states. These findings create opportunities for developing new combination therapy strategies for osteosarcoma treatment and underscore the value of defining epigenetic subtypes in highly genomically complex cancers.\nThis study identifies two distinct cellular states in osteosarcoma, driven by specific transcription factor circuitries linked to normal bone development. These epigenetically defined states demonstrate differential drug responses, are identifiable in patient samples, and are correlated with survival.",

    "abstract": "The combination of 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) remains a standard-of-care treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) yet benefits only about half of patients. Using patient-derived xenografts, we investigated the biological underpinnings of this heterogeneous response. FOLFIRI-resistant models showed transcriptional upregulation of innate immunity and mitochondrial metabolism genes, together with reduced expression of the DNA polymerase POLD1. Sensitive counterparts exhibited a BRCAness-like phenotype with genomic scars of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, not caused by genetic or epigenetic loss of HR genes but by low abundance of the RAD51 recombinase. In tumoroids, forced RAD51 overexpression attenuated HR deficiency-related scars and chemotherapy-induced damage, whereas HR inhibition through ATM blockade enhanced drug sensitivity. The predictive relevance of key response determinants was validated in clinical samples. This work illuminates functional, nongenetic facets of BRCAness in mCRC and introduces actionable biomarkers and targets, offering prospects to improve clinical decision-making and broaden therapeutic options for chemorefractory patients.\nFOLFIRI response biomarkers in mCRC are lacking. Evidence in patient-derived xenografts, tumoroids, and patients shows that chemosensitivity arises from functional relaxation, rather than (epi)genetic inactivation, of the HR DNA repair pathway. Integrative analyses yield a chemopredictive algorithm centered on the expression of the RAD51 recombinase, with potential to refine patient stratification.",
