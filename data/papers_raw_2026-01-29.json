Aberrant activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in symptom exacerbation in OCD. We conducted an intracranial monitoring assay to identify high-resolution neurophysiologic correlates of OCD symptoms in the human OFC. We found that low-gamma power in the anteromedial OFC was consistently elevated during high symptom states in a symptom provocation task. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of the ventral basal ganglia that reduced OCD symptoms also reduced anteromedial OFC gamma power. These results link OFC gamma activity to moment-to-moment expression of OCD symptoms, providing mechanistic insights to guide therapeutic strategies such as deep brain stimulation.",

Here, using a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics platform, FLEXITau, deep characterization of pathological tau protein isolated from the brains of 203 human subjects with AD, familial AD (fAD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease (PiD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)-a non-tauopathy symptomatic control-and healthy controls (CTR) is performed.

    "abstract": "Cancer presents a remarkably instructive perturbation of mechanisms manifesting in our biology that have gone awry, eliciting a malady that is inexorably increasing in incidence and societal burden concomitant with healthier aging. The wealth of knowledge and data forthcoming from decades of cancer research can be organized into conceptually distinct but interconnected parametric dimensions that define the mechanistic foundation of the disease: aberrantly acquired functional capabilities (the hallmarks of cancer), enabling phenotypic characteristics, hallmark-conveying cells populating cancer microenvironments, and systemic interactions. Collectively, they provide a logical framework with which to illuminate the operating systems of these outlaw organs, from inception through multistage tumorigenesis to adaptive evolution. This review presents a concise synthesis of the hallmark conceptualization as it has been refined during the past 25 years, including a corollary hypothesis that mechanism-guided hallmark co-targeting could offer impactful new therapeutic strategies for treating human cancers.",

We investigated LN-mediated immunosuppression in patients with head-and-neck cancer using spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, and an in vivo model of melanoma LN metastasis. Both primary tumors and paired LNs of nodal-positive patients exhibit enhanced interferon-\u03b3 signaling and an enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (calves). The spatial intersection of these myeloid-CAF-enriched niches with perifollicular T cell zones and LN follicles is linked to enhanced T cell dysfunction and Treg activation therein, thereby driving architectural LN remodeling. These immune suppressive changes extend to adjacent non-tumor-involved LN regions and nearby tumor-free LNs, but were not detected in LNs of non-cancer patients, reflecting a systemic effect that compromises anti-tumor immunity beyond the tumor-involved LN. Hence, our findings establish LN colonization as an active driver of systemic immunosuppression, facilitating metastatic progression.",

    "abstract": "Assigning valence-appeal or aversion-to gustatory stimuli and relaying it to higher-order brain regions to guide flexible behaviors is crucial to survival. Yet the neural circuits that transform taste into motivationally relevant signals remain poorly defined in any model system. In Drosophila melanogaster, substantial progress has been made in mapping the sensorimotor pathways encoding intrinsic valence for feeding and the architecture of the dopaminergic reinforcement system. However, where and how \"effective\" (i.e., real-time) valence is first imposed on a taste has long been a mystery. Here, we identified a pair of subesophageal zone interneurons in Drosophila, termed Fox, that impart reinforcing positive valence to sweet taste and convey this signal to the mushroom body, the fly's associative learning center. We show that Fox neuron activity is necessary and sufficient to drive appetitive behaviors and can override a tastant's intrinsic neutral or aversive valence without impairing taste quality discrimination. Furthermore, Fox neurons relay the positive valence to specific dopaminergic neurons that mediate appetitive memory formation. Our findings reveal a circuit mechanism through which effective valence is bestowed upon sweet sensation and transformed into a reinforcing signal that supports learned sugar responses. The Fox neurons form a convergent-divergent \"hourglass\" circuit motif, acting as a bottleneck for valence assignment and distributing motivational signals to higher-order centers. This architecture confers both robustness and flexibility in reward processing-an organizational principle that may generalize across species.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive memory decline associated with hippocampal degeneration. However, the specific physiological mechanisms underlying hippocampal dysfunction in the disease remain poorly understood-improved knowledge may aid diagnosis and identify new avenues for therapeutic intervention. We investigated how disruptions in hippocampal reactivations relate to place cell stability and spatial memory deficits in an Alzheimer's mouse model. Using the App knockin mouse model NL-G-F, we conducted simultaneous behavioral and electrophysiological recordings in a radial arm maze. NL-G-F mice exhibited significant impairments in memory performance, demonstrated by an increased propensity to revisit arms, compared with wild-type controls. These memory deficits were associated with reduced stability of hippocampal place cells, which was particularly pronounced following rest periods. Crucially, although wild-type mice showed enhanced place cell stability after quiescence, NL-G-F mice failed to exhibit this consolidation. Although the rate of hippocampal reactivation events during rest remained unchanged, analysis of replay content revealed significantly degraded replay quality in NL-G-F mice. This degradation manifested as disrupted cell recruitment and reduced co-firing structure within reactivation events, both of which predicted the failure of offline place cell stabilization. Together, these findings suggest that compromised reactivation quality may underlie disruptions in offline consolidation processes, offering a potential mechanism for memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.",

However, xenogeneic barriers-such as mismatched developmental timing, cell adhesion differences, and intercellular competition-restrict the contribution of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to non-human embryos. Here, we report that Cas13 collateral RNA cleavage can be harnessed to selectively attenuate host cell proliferation to boost donor cell chimerism. In mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs), Cas13 activation degraded target RNAs and bystander transcripts, producing a reversible decrease in cell proliferation while preserving pluripotency. In co-culture, selective attenuation of mEpiSCs enhanced the competitiveness and survival of wild-type mEpiSCs and hPSCs in both intra- and interspecies settings. In vivo, blastocysts engineered with inducible Cas13 (iCas13) showed increased donor cell integration in chimeric embryos and adult tissues. Together, these findings demonstrate a generalizable strategy to modulate donor-host dynamics and mitigate xenogeneic barriers to interspecies organogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of novel pharmaceuticals and targeted therapeutic approaches is considerably obstructed by the insufficient comprehension of the intricate pathophysiology of colorectal cancer (CRC). The therapeutic effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)-based systemic treatment for advanced CRC is limited by medication resistance. Research has revealed that therapeutic strategies aimed at the myosin light chain kinase family member 4 (MYLK4) and its corresponding response element can suppress tumour proliferation and yield significant clinical advantages for cancer patients. This study reveals that MYLK4-mediated lipid metabolic reprogramming confers resistance to TKI-induced ferroptosis in CRC. MYLK4 directly interacts with tripartite motif containing 15 (TRIM15) in a way reliant on mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), hence enhancing p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Significantly, p53 suppresses the transcription of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) through binding to its promoter. Elevated SCD1 levels correlate with increased MYLK4 levels, and their concurrent expression forecasts regorafenib resistance and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. Regorafenib and SCD1 inhibitor (SCD1 inhibitor-3) co-treatment demonstrate promising anti-tumor efficacy in organoids and xenografted tumours derived from wild-type p53 colorectal cancer patients. Patients with colorectal cancer exhibiting elevated MYLK4 activity and wild-type p53 may derive clinical benefits from this combination therapy. These results suggest that MYLK4 may serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer.",

The treatment of IAV-challenged Rag1-KO mice with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) triggers NK cell-intrinsic signaling of PD-L1 and significantly delays lethality. This treatment upregulates tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand on NK cells downstream of PD-L1 signaling and is required for the benefits of PD-L1 mAb treatment in IAV-challenged Rag1-KO mice.

    "abstract": "Cytokines and their receptors play important roles in brain development and aging-related disease, but their functions within the healthy adult brain remain poorly understood. Here, we show that pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA1 induce Fn14 expression in response to activity and environmental enrichment. Once expressed, Fn14 dampens the activity of these neurons most prominently at the daily transition between light and dark. Fn14 expression in CA1 neurons is regulated by the circadian transcription factor Bmal1, and mice lacking Fn14 exhibit disrupted sleep-wake patterns in vivo. At the cellular level, microglia contact fewer excitatory synapses in the absence of Fn14, while neuronal overexpression of Fn14 induces rod-like microglia and recruits them to excitatory synapses. Beyond a homeostatic context, mice lacking Fn14 exhibit heightened susceptibility to chemically induced seizures. These findings reveal that pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors such as Fn14 can play major roles in healthy neurological function in the adult brain.",

Colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes were largely clonally distinct from lamina propria T cells. Tissue-resident T cells in colon vs. liver displayed marked transcriptional divergence, with colonic lamina propria tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) enriched for interferon-stimulated genes (e.g., ISG15 and IFITM3). Ligand-receptor analysis implicated liver-derived factors, including fibrinogen gamma chain, in shaping colon TRM states.

This study aimed to demonstrate that E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 regulates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of SNAP29, thereby modulating SNARE assembly. We found that HRD1 deficiency enhances autophagy activity and promotes autolysosome formation in a SNAP29-dependent manner. We also determined that SNAP29 forms highly dynamic condensates in in vivo and in vitro, which are crucial for the assembly of the SNARE complex. Mechanistically, HRD1 interacts with SNAP29 to suppress its condensation, whereas HRD1 depletion accelerates both SNAP29 condensate formation and SNARE complex assembly. Our findings reveal that HRD1 acts as a negative regulator in autolysosome formation by interacting with SNAP29, inhibiting its LLPS process, thereby modulating the binding affinity among SNARE components.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians typically avoid antibiotics use during immunotherapy due to concerns about reduced efficacy. However, cancer patients requiring antibiotics postoperatively or for infections urgently need options that provide antimicrobial coverage while potentially enhancing, rather than impairing, immunotherapy. Restoring ferroptosis susceptibility represents a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance, yet the role of antibiotics in modulating ferroptosis and interacting with immunotherapy remains unexplored. In this study, we screened 96 FDA-approved antibiotics across seven pharmacological classes and identified the macrolide kitasamycin as a specific and potent ferroptosis sensitizer in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, kitasamycin competitively bound to HUWE1, inhibiting its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which stabilized NCOA4 and activated the NCOA4-FTH1 ferritinophagy axis. Single-cell transcriptomics, flow cytometry, and multiplex immunohistochemistry revealed that kitasamycin induced immunogenic ferroptosis and reshaped anti-tumor T-cell immunity. Critically, kitasamycin potentiated immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-mediated ferroptosis and overcame ICB resistance across multiple preclinical melanoma models, including B16F10 subcutaneous tumors, BRAF-PTEN-driven spontaneous tumors, and human sourced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HsPBMCs)-humanized mouse models. Clinically, a high NCOA4, low HUWE1 signature correlated with ferroptosis activation, increased T-cell infiltration, and improved survival in ICB-treated patients, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker. Our findings positioned kitasamycin as a promising adjunct to immunotherapy for cancer patients requiring concurrent antibiotic therapy. ",

    "title": "Newcastle disease virus hijacks mitophagy to reprogram amino acid metabolism for enhanced replication.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria serve as the cellular \"power plants,\" supplying energy and regulating metabolism, signal transduction, and other physiological processes. To successfully replicate within host cells, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to hijack mitochondrial functions. The oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes severe organelle damage in tumor cells; however, how it manipulates mitochondrial architecture to facilitate its own replication remains poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that NDV infection disrupts mitochondrial spatial distribution and imbalances mitochondrial fusion and fission, leading to mitochondrial structural damage. The resulting accumulation of fragmented mitochondria is cleared via PRKN-dependent mitophagy, a process that supports NDV replication. Interestingly, although MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) is degraded along with mitophagy, genetic ablation of PRKN - while blocking MAVS degradation - does not restore downstream innate immune responses. This indicates that NDV exploits mitophagy to enhance replication through mechanisms not entirely dependent on the suppression of MAVS-mediated immunity. Given the central role of mitochondria, we further explored the link between amino acid metabolism and viral proliferation after NDV infection. Our results show that NDV-induced mitophagy leads to the accumulation of free amino acids in host cells, and this metabolic reprogramming promotes viral replication. In summary, we show that NDV drives its replication by remodeling mitochondrial dynamics to induce mitophagy, which in turn triggers an amino acid metabolic reprogramming that benefits the virus. This provides new insights into the mechanisms supporting efficient oncolytic NDV replication, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in oncolytic virus therapy.",

    "title": "Energy metabolism and adaptation to hypoxia in the non-photosynthetic green alga Leontynka.",
    "abstract": "Leontynka is a non-photosynthetic lineage of the order Chlamydomonadales (Chlorophyta). Although many Chlamydomonadales members encode components of the anaerobic energy metabolism, studies focused on Chlamydomonadales algae thriving in hypoxia and not prospering in oxic conditions are missing. Using a combination of experimental approaches, comparative genomics, and advanced in silico protein localization analyses, we employed Leontynka as a model to investigate the evolution of anaerobiosis in Chlamydomonadales.\nLeontynka spp. accumulate a wide range of storage forms, enabling them to cope with nutritional stresses. Their mitochondria contain well-developed cristae mediating a conventional aerobic energy metabolism. Moreover, colocalization of a Raman signal for cytochromes with the position of mitochondria in the cell indicates that oxidative phosphorylation is an important route of energy metabolism in the alga. Interestingly, Leontynka spp. concentrate enzymes potentially involved in oxygen-independent ATP synthesis within the plastid, which lost the ability to produce ATP using proton gradient generated by membrane complexes that exploit redox reactions. We analyzed the composition of prokaryotic communities co-isolated with Leontynka spp. and hypothesize that their preference for hypoxic/microoxic conditions is facilitated by metabolic interactions with certain microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria.\nThis study represents the first comprehensive analysis of microaerophilic Chlamydomonadales algae. Having retained several ancestral enzymes of the anaerobic energy metabolism, Leontynka represents a unique vantage point for understanding the evolution of the hydrogen production machinery and adaptations to low oxygen in Chlamydomonadales (and core chlorophytes in general). Our findings suggest that the plastid of non-photosynthetic Leontynka follows a similar evolutionary path as mitochondria when adapting to anaerobiosis and parallels the transition of a mitochondrion into a hydrogenosome.",

    "abstract": "Given the ecological importance of reef-building corals (Scleractinia), it is perhaps surprising that the molecular mechanisms underlying many of the morphological and metabolic changes during their development remain unclear. In part, this is due to the lack of a comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for any coral. A second challenge in the analysis of such non-model developmental datasets is that the volume of data often complicates its interpretation.\nTo overcome these limitations, we profiled gene expression in Acropora millepora across 26 life stages from unfertilised eggs to juvenile polyps and developed an interactive online tool based on the R-application Shiny to simultaneously visualise changes in the expression of large numbers of genes. As expected, major transcriptomic changes (transitions) occurred during gastrulation and the acquisition of competence. Surprisingly, however, settlement triggered by using an extract of the natural inducing crustose coralline alga did not immediately lead to major changes in gene expression, but a major transition involving many genes was observed 3-6\u00a0h after settlement induction.\nWe hope that providing access to this extensive developmental transcriptome dataset and software to facilitate its analysis will expedite a better understanding of the changes that occur during coral development. The online tool is available at https://amil-deview.mmb.group.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), an anti-HER2-drug conjugate, has transformed treatment for HER2-expressing solid tumors. However, heterogeneous intratumoral HER2 expression, particularly high densities of HER2-immunohistochemistry score 0 (HER2-IHC 0) cells, limits its clinical efficacy. Here, we discovered that targeted inhibition of F-box protein FBXL2 elevates HER2 expression on the plasma membrane of HER2-IHC 0 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, thereby sensitizing them to T-DXd. Mechanistically, FBXL2 promotes HER2 polyubiquitination at K747 and proteasomal degradation. Notably, small molecules GGTi-2418 and ketoconazole effectively elevate HER2 expression via blocking FBXL2 membrane localization. We further developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to encapsulate GGTi-2418 and ketoconazole, enabling their enrichment in TNBC tumors. Strikingly, GGTi-2418@LNP or ketoconazole@LNP combined with T-DXd induced robust and durable tumor regression in HER2-IHC 0 TNBC xenograft models in female mice. Together, this study highlights that targeted inhibition of FBXL2 combined with T-DXd may be a viable therapeutic strategy for treating HER2-IHC 0 solid tumors.",

Here we report the results of cohort A of the trial, evaluating the pathological complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade in surgically resectable desmoplastic melanoma. Secondary endpoints included clinical response rate, overall survival and toxicities. Twenty-eight eligible individuals with resectable desmoplastic melanoma received intravenous pembrolizumab (200\u2009mg) every 3 weeks three times, followed by excision. Tissue samples before treatment, at 3-5 weeks after treatment initiation and at the time of surgery were reviewed. The primary endpoint of pCR rate by local pathological review was 71% (95% confidence interval, 51-87%; P\u2009<\u20090.001), which met the prespecified endpoint. There were two (7%) grade 3 treatment-related adverse events. At three years of follow-up, four participants have died, none known to be from melanoma or adverse events. In conclusion, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in individuals with resectable desmoplastic melanoma results in a high pCR rate with acceptable safety profile. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02775851 .",

    "title": "Fasting-mimicking diet induces IFN\u03b2 secretion in tumor-associated macrophages via NRF1-mediated ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of Trex1.",
    "abstract": "Fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) is a safe and effective strategy in clinical oncology via metabolically restricting tumour growth and remodelling the immunity. To date, few studies have investigated the impact of on tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), which are a crucial component of immune cells in the tumour microenvironment. Fasting can induce the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to regulate intracellular protein turnover homoeostasis, while Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-like 1 (NRF1; encoded by the gene Nfe2l1), which controls proteasome gene transcription, may potentially be induced by fasting. However, whether NRF1 is induced by FMD/fasting, and how NRF1-mediated protein turnover works on TAMs remain unknown. This study investigated the hypothesis that FMD activates the anti-tumour immunity of TAMs by ubiquitinated protein metabolism.\nSubcutaneous MC38 tumour models were established in WT and myeloid-specific NRF1 knockout (Mye-NFE2L1\nFMD/fasting triggers interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) secretion in TAMs, which is driven by protein metabolism. In TAMs with FMD, an initial accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins occurs concomitantly with the induction of NRF1 in response to fasting-induced energy stress, leading to the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis of the three prime repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1) through UPS. Such a process engages type I interferon responses, which derepress the cGAS-Sting-IFN\u03b2 axis to promote anti-tumour effects of TAMs. In the absence of NRF1, Trex1 accumulates due to impaired UPS and binds to mtDNA, disrupting cGAS sensing of mtDNA to inhibit IFN\u03b2 secretion in TAMs, which attenuates anti-tumour effects of FMD/fasting.\nIn this study, we revealed for the first time that FMD/fasting coordinates NRF1-UPS and Trex1/Sting-mediated type I interferon responses in TAMs that contribute to suppressing tumour growth. Graphical abstract: FMD upregulates the entry of NRF1 into the TAM nucleus to promote gene expression of proteasome subunits, which induces the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis of Trex1, leading to derepression of the cGAS-Sting-IFN\u03b2 axis. On the other hand, FMD triggers increasing of mtDNA in TAMs, promoting the cGAS-Sting-IFN\u03b2 axis to release IFN\u03b2. In myeloid NRF1 knockout TAMs, transcriptional levels of proteasome subunits are reduced, resulting in impaired proteolysis of Trex1 and its subsequent accumulation during fasting. Then, Trex1 binds to mtDNA, directing the inhibition of the cGAS-Sting-IFN\u03b2 axis and inhibiting IFN\u03b2 secretion of macrophages.",

Here, we investigated BBB penetration using brain endothelial spheroids and cerebral tissue-derived organoids that recapitulate three-dimensional barrier features. We show that T. gondii tachyzoites efficiently colonize spheroids, without detectable barrier disruption or obligatory parasite replication. Following direct transmigration, tachyzoites invaded and replicated within deeper cell layers. Type I strains (RH, CPS) exhibited higher colonization efficiency than type II strains (PRU, ME49), independent of replication. In contrast, when spheroids were exposed to T. gondii-infected dendritic cells (DCs), both strain types were transported similarly into deep cellular layers. Infected DCs adopted an amoeboid-like migratory phenotype that facilitated parasite transport and subsequent dissemination after egress. Colonization was attenuated by ICAM-1 blockade or heparin treatment, while the parasite effector GRA15, despite modulating DC-endothelial adhesion, did not significantly impact intratissue migration. In contrast, deletion of the effector TgWIP markedly reduced the number of infected DCs entering the spheroids. Similar colonization dynamics were observed in murine cerebral organoids. Collectively, these findings highlight spheroid and organoid models as robust systems for uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying T. gondii BBB traversal and CNS colonization.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer that is usually diagnosed at a late stage and has a modest clinical response and poor prognosis. Therefore, identifying targets for the effective treatment of PDAC is particularly important. STAM-binding protein (STAMBP) is a JAMM metalloprotease of the deubiquitinase (DUB) family that typically regulates the stabilization and trafficking of substrates in a range of cell types by specifically removing ubiquitin chains. However, its roles in the initiation and progression of PDAC remain unclear. Here, we found that STAMBP is highly expressed in PDAC and is associated with a poor prognosis. STAMBP facilitates the proliferation and migration of PDAC cells and the growth of pancreatic cancer xenograft tumours in mice. We then identified the cochaperone BAG3, which plays a pivotal role in tumourigenesis, as a potential substrate of STAMBP using mass spectrometry (MS). Mechanistically, STAMBP interacts with BAG3 and promotes its stabilization by removing its K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. The Lys29 and Lys60 residues of BAG3 are essential for the K63-linked ubiquitination of BAG3. Moreover, a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism of STAMBP was identified as follows: STAMBP is phosphorylated by IKK\u03b1 at Ser2 without affecting STAMBP protein abundance, and this phosphorylation enables it to deubiquitinate BAG3. In addition, we found that STAMBP deficiency effectively increases cisplatin/oxaliplatin sensitivity in PDAC. Overall, IKK\u03b1 phosphorylates STAMBP at Set 2, which activates STAMBP to deubiquitinase BAG3, thus resulting in an IKK\u03b1/STAMBP/BAG3 signaling axis that promotes PDAC progression. STAMBP might serve as a potential therapeutic target for PDAC therapy.",

    "title": "Loss of BOK increases vulnerability of p53 deficient non-small cell lung cancer cells to ATR inhibition through its role in uridine metabolism.",
    "abstract": "BOK is a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family frequently repressed in cancer and with emerging roles beyond apoptosis. BOK interacts with and increases uridine monophosphate synthetase (UMPS) activity, thereby promoting uridine monophosphate (UMP) synthesis. We previously showed that BOK protein is downregulated in primary human lung cancer samples, correlating with poorer patient survival. Here, we demonstrate that BOK deficiency increases DNA damage, triggering p53 activation and cell cycle arrest in two independent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell models that express either WT or defective p53. In a p53-deficient setting, BOK loss caused elevated baseline DNA damage rendering cells more dependent on alternative DNA repair pathways. We exploited this vulnerability by inhibiting the ATR-mediated DNA damage response pathway with the selective ATR inhibitor ceralasertib (AZD6738). ATR inhibition in BOK/p53 compound-deficient NSCLC cells exacerbated DNA damage and induced cell death, indicating a synthetic lethal interaction. The DNA damage in BOK-deficient cells was rescued by a cell permeable BOK-BH3-derived peptide, confirming the mechanistic link between BOK and UMPS. Taken together, our findings reveal a vulnerability in NSCLC, where combined loss of p53 and BOK sensitises cells to ATR inhibition. This synthetic interaction suggests that p53-deficient tumours with reduced BOK expression may be more reliant on ATR-mediated DNA repair, providing a mechanistic basis for their susceptibility to ATR inhibitors. Given the frequent inactivation of p53 in lung cancer, our study offers a rationale for clinical exploration of ATR inhibitors, in combination with standard chemotherapy, in the context of reduced BOK function. Future investigations into the broader role of BOK in genomic stability and nucleotide metabolism may uncover additional therapeutic strategies for cancers with repressed BOK.",

However, it remains unclear whether these relationships persist at larger spatial scales. Combining a field survey of plant diversity with remote sensing estimates of primary productivity across a large environmental gradient in 235 grasslands across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Inner Mongolia Plateau, we find that species richness contributes to stabilizing productivity, while functional diversity contributes to destabilizing productivity at the local scale. In contrast, we find no evidence that variation in species richness and functional diversity among local communities contributes to stabilizing productivity across larger spatial scales. While the relationships between environmental conditions and local diversity and stability differ between the two regions, the overall positive relationships between diversity and stability are consistent at both the local and larger spatial scales. Our study offers insights into how functional traits along the fast-slow leaf economics spectrum mediate the effects of environmental factors (e.g., precipitation) on ecosystem stability at contrasting spatial scales.",

As part of a set of multi-omics experiments, we performed an extensive case-control proteomics study on 192 post-mortem tissue sections from prefrontal cortex from 96 individuals, including 47 cases with schizophrenia and 49 healthy controls. Using two independently measured cortical datasets, we identified 387 proteins differentially expressed between schizophrenia cases and controls at a 5% FDR threshold. This significantly regulated set of proteins contains genes located in GWAS-identified schizophrenia loci and proteins identified by pQTL analysis. Gene ontology analysis using GOAT provided evidence for regulation of several major protein categories, emphasizing downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative respiration, ribosomes and the proteasome, upregulation of kinases and (small) GTPases. SynGO analysis supports the notion of synaptic dysfunction in schizophrenia, with major regulators of pre- and postsynaptic function compromised. Our findings highlight the complex molecular dysregulation in schizophrenia, with mitochondrial function downregulated versus signaling and trafficking upregulated, and synapse function disrupted; in combination with prior avenues of research, these finding support a role for energy deficits compromising highly ATP dependent neuronal function as a target for therapeutic interventions.",

    "title": "Pantropical moist forests are converging towards a middle leaf longevity.",
    "abstract": "Leaf longevity is a fundamental plant trait that largely explains ecosystem functional dynamics in global pantropical moist forests. However, the signs, magnitudes, and mechanisms of the spatiotemporal variations in leaf longevity with ongoing climate change are still lacking. Using both ground measurements and gridded leaf age-dependent leaf area index data, we map the continental-scale variability of annual mean leaf longevity across pantropical moist forests over 2001-2023. We find a biome-dependent and converging trend in leaf longevity under climate change. In Amazon and tropical Asia with long leaf longevity (> ~1.8 years), leaf longevity decreases due to rising temperature and intensified atmospheric dryness. In contrast, an increasing trend is observed in Congo and subtropical Asia where forests have short leaf longevity (<~1.8 years). These responses cause a convergence of pantropical short and long leaf longevity into a middle longevity range, with maximization of plant functional traits, photosynthesis, and species evenness, which are expected to better resist climate variability. Our study provides emerging evidence for large-scale structural and functional adaptions across pantropical moist forests and is helpful for predicting climate-driven risks to ecosystem stability.",

By studying familial clusters of the disease, here we identify a significant association between genetic variants in the V-set and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 10 Like (VSIG10L) gene and BE predisposition. Using mammalian tissues and patient-derived organoids, we show VSIG10L is selectively expressed in the suprabasal squamous cells of the esophageal mucosa and is essential for epithelial maturation and homeostasis. Mice carrying human-orthologous germline mutations in Vsig10l exhibit loss of desmosomes, concomitant with disrupted epithelial differentiation programs, in the squamous mucosa. Upon long-term exposure to a bile acid (deoxycholate) supplemented diet, Vsig10l-mutant mice develop overt BE-like lesions in the forestomach. Furthermore, loss of esophageal VSIG10L expression is observed frequently in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, a known risk factor for BE. Collectively, our study uncovers a fundamental link between VSIG10L, esophageal homeostasis, and BE predisposition.",

    "abstract": "Isoxazoles, oxazoles, and other five-membered heteroaromatics are prevalent motifs in core structure of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In early-stage drug discovery, it is common practice to prepare libraries of analogues featuring different heterocyclic cores and this generally requires a de novo synthesis for each scaffold. A valuable but currently unavailable strategy would involve the possibility for direct heterocycle \"ring-replacement\". Here we report a photochemical platform for the selective conversion of isoxazoles into oxazoles, pyrazoles, pyrroles, and isothiazoles by exploiting excited-state reactivity. Starting from a successful isoxazole-to-oxazole transformation, we uncover position-sensitive reactivity that prompted computational investigation. These insights guide a systematic reactivity survey and reveal a solvent-controlled deconstruction-reconstruction pathway via \u03b1-ketonitrile intermediates. This approach enables scaffold diversification without de novo synthesis, affording access to five distinct azole classes under mild conditions. The method's selectivity, functional group tolerance, and late-stage applicability suggest broad utility in heterocyclic library design for pharmaceutical research.",

    "abstract": "The astrocytic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter, GAT3, is essential for terminating GABAergic signaling in the central nervous system. Selective inhibition of GAT3 offers a potential strategy for elevating extracellular GABA levels for the treatment of neurological disorders including epilepsy. However, few potent and selective GAT3 inhibitors have been developed, and their mechanisms of inhibition remain poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length, wild-type human GAT3, hGAT3, bound to a selective inhibitor, to substrate GABA, or in substrate-free state. hGAT3 bound to the inhibitor or in the substrate-free state exhibits an inward-open conformation. The inhibitor binds within the intracellular permeation pathway, positioned between transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. The GABA-bound hGAT3 is captured in an inward-occluded state, revealing the ion coordination and substrate recognition network, including a cation-\u03c0 interaction between GABA's \u03b3-amino group and a phenylalanine residue in transmembrane helix 6. Our data reveal the molecular determinants for the inhibitor selectivity, and the mode of substrate binding and transport inhibition, providing blueprints for the rational design of next-generation selective GAT3 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Targeting the protein quality control system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents a promising and underexplored opportunity for antibiotic development. The ClpC1:ClpP1P2 protease is an essential component of the system that mediates both regulatory and stress-related protein degradation. Several non-ribosomal peptide natural products, including ecumicin, ilamycins (rufomycins) and cyclomarins, have been discovered that bind to the ClpC1 chaperone of the complex and exhibit potent antimycobacterial activity, leading to significant interest in the ClpC1:ClpP1P2 system as a bona fide target for the new tuberculosis drugs. In this study, we combine quantitative proteomics, bioinformatics, transcriptomics, CRISPRi knockdown, and targeted biochemical and biophysical assays to dissect the mechanisms of ecumicin, ilamycin and cyclomarin in clinically relevant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Strikingly, despite exhibiting similar binding modes to ClpC1, each compound induces distinct effects on protein degradation. Notably, ilamycin and ecumicin do not trigger the ClpC2 rescue mechanism that mitigates cyclomarin-induced mycobacterial toxicity. In addition, we identify a novel interaction between ecumicin and stress-response chaperone Hsp20. The differential disruption of ClpC1 substrates, stress-response chaperones, and distinct reshaping of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteome by the three natural products, unveils new opportunities for the development of protein quality control-targeted antimycobacterials.",

    "abstract": "Neural crest cells (NCC) are a migratory progenitor cell population unique to vertebrates that contribute to nearly every organ system throughout the body. Disruptions in NCC development can result in congenital disorders (neurocristopathies). Yet, our understanding of the cellular mechanisms and signals that govern mammalian NCC formation remains poor. Here, we discovered nuclear receptor superfamily 6 group member 1 (NR6A1/GCNF/RTR) is a novel, critical regulator of mammalian NCC specification, formation and survival. Nr6a1 expression in mouse embryos spatiotemporally overlaps with early NCC development. NR6A1 loss-of-function perturbs anterior cranial NCC formation and survival, with complete agenesis of migratory NCC caudal to the first pharyngeal arch. Using targeted molecular and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that these phenotypes are associated with perturbation of NCC specification and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and with persistent expression of pluripotency-associated factors. Supporting these observations, in vivo overexpression of Oct4 in gastrulating mouse embryos disrupts NCC specification and formation. Conditional temporal deletion revealed that Nr6a1 is required during mid-late gastrulation, demonstrating that the initiation of murine NCC specification likely occurs during gastrulation - earlier than previously thought, but in close alignment with the established timeline of NCC development in other vertebrate model organisms. These findings also reveal that the gold standard transgenic mouse line, Wnt1-Cre, is unsuitable for studying genetic function during NCC specification and formation. In summary, NR6A1 is essential for mammalian NCC development and may function during gastrulation as a bimodal switch modulating pluripotency-associated factors in the neuroepithelium, while concomitantly activating NCC specifiers and regulators of EMT.",

The molecular chiroptical signals, however, are typically weak for chiral molecular sensing in conventional circular dichroism using photonic spin angular momentum, even in the presence of a large number of chiral molecules (micromoles to millimoles). Here, by involving chiral light-matter interaction with photonic orbital angular momentum, we demonstrate strong chiroptical responses that reflect the molecular chirality in a single chiral nanoassembly. We experimentally present the helical dichroism spectra of chiral nanoassemblies synthesized from L/D-cystines, consistent with electromagnetic simulations. The asymmetry factors in the fundamental wavelength and photoluminescence emission reach values of 0.53 and 1.18, respectively, exceeding those observed in the circular dichroism mechanism. To improve the dimensions of helical dichroism spectroscopy, we analyze helical dichroism in wavelength domain, polarization domain, and momentum space.

Azithromycin MDA also selected for antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly macrolide resistance. It is unknown whether the AMR from azithromycin MDA could spill over to neighboring untreated populations. If present, such geographic spillover effects could lead trials to underestimate AMR risks. We assess between-village geographic spillover effects of genotypic macrolide resistance using metagenomic deep sequencing in rectal swabs collected from 300 children in 30 monitoring villages in Niger after two years of MDA in 594 surrounding villages. Conditional permutation tests assess associations between proximal azithromycin treatment intensity and resistance gene abundance. We find no evidence of geographic spillover of macrolide resistance in untreated villages, as the genetic load of AMR remains at baseline levels in placebo-treated villages regardless of surrounding azithromycin treatment intensity (Spearman \u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.05, P\u2009=\u20090.83). Sensitivity analyses confirm robustness across metrics, and no spillover effects are detected for other antibiotic classes. Azithromycin MDA-induced macrolide resistance appears localized to treated villages, mitigating some concerns about geographic spillover of AMR to nearby untreated villages at 24 months.",

We show major LLMs to exhibit mosaic memory, with fuzzy duplicates contributing to memorization as much as 0.8 of an exact duplicate and even heavily modified sequences contributing substantially to memorization. Despite models displaying significant reasoning capabilities, we somewhat surprisingly show memorization to be predominantly syntactic rather than semantic. We finally show fuzzy duplicates to be ubiquitous in real-world data, untouched by deduplication techniques.

A personalized drug-cue-reactivity task was administered while recording NAc electrophysiology from a lead externalized for clinical purposes. We identified a drug-cue-evoked electrophysiological signal in the ventral NAc that was associated with an elevated craving state and attenuated with stimulation delivered to the same area. This electrophysiological biomarker, along with behavioral assessments, informed the re-programming of DBS to a more focal and effective stimulation site. This resulted in sustained suppression of drug-related cravings. This study represents a proof-of-principle for a personalized, biomarker-informed neuromodulation strategy in OUD.",

In most bacteria, the division and cell wall (dcw) gene cluster is regulated by the first gene of the dcw operon, mraZ, a highly conserved DNA-binding transcriptional regulator. Here we report the structural basis of MraZ transcriptional regulation by the resolution of three different cryo-EM structures of MraZ in complex with the upstream promoter region of the dcw cluster from Mycoplasma genitalium at 3.36, 3.57 and 3.87\u2009\u00c5 resolution. The structures reveal the specific interactions between MraZ DNA-binding motif and nucleobases of the binding boxes, which induces distortion in the MraZ octamer to enable the interaction with the four repetitive binding boxes of the promoter DNA. The \"cradle-like\" DNA-binding motif of MraZ exposes three highly conserved basic residues, Lys13, Arg15 and Arg86, which are essential for binding to the consensus sequence of its cognate promoter. Ultimately, the mechanism behind MraZ's DNA binding and regulation of the dcw operon could be translated to other species, working as a general mechanism for the regulation of dcw gene cluster in bacteria.",

    "title": "Coordinated gene family evolution shapes the genome of dimorphic Mucorales.",
    "abstract": "Dimorphic organisms possess the remarkable genome capacity to alternate genetic information between two distinct life forms. In dimorphic Mucorales, lineages can reversibly transition between yeast and mycelium as a function of environmental stimuli. However, how genetic information produces two divergent life evolves in a single genome remains unresolved. Here, we report hundreds of gene families exhibiting convergent evolution for dimorphism. This adaptation involves paralog functionalization and the coordination of expression, with yeast and mycelium-specific paralogs. Though these gene families have distinct functions, all their paralogs are convergently adapted to produce yeast and mycelium morphologies. In addition, dimorphic gene families with related functions form head-to-head structures, coordinating differential expression. This coordinated regulation is controlled by two new genes, dkl and dfl. Loss of function of these genes results in global dysregulation of gene expression and loss of dimorphism. Dimorphic gene families, head-to-head marker loci, and the dfl gene are conserved across various dimorphic species but are absent in closely related monomorphic species. Our findings identify an evolutionary mechanism that integrates and optimizes the genetic information required for two distinct life forms within a single organism.",

    "abstract": "Shape memory alloys with both a large elastocaloric effect and exceptional fatigue resistance are key candidates for next-generation solid-state cooling technologies. Here, we report a textured TiNi alloy containing engineered Ti\u2084Ni\u2082O precipitates, fabricated via controlled directional solidification, that achieves a large adiabatic temperature change of -15.9\u2009K after 10 million compressive cycles. Microstructural analyses reveal columnar B2 grains aligned with the solidification direction and a uniform dispersion of high-density Ti\u2084Ni\u2082O precipitates. A strong crystallographic texture is observed, enabling a large transformation strain of over 6% under compressive loading, as mapped by digital image correlation. In-situ loading X-ray diffraction confirms a continuous increase in intensity of B19' martensite under stress, while in-situ cooling transmission electron microscopy captures numerous nucleation and progressive growth of the B19' martensite from B2/Ti\u2084Ni\u2082O interfaces. High-resolution TEM further reveals localized lattice distortions at these interfaces, promoting directional and confined growth of B19' martensite. This progressive transformation, which preserves functional reversibility, combined with the mutual texture-precipitate architecture that enhances mechanical stability, gives rise to ultrahigh fatigue life. These findings highlight the promise of textured TiNi with tailored precipitate architecture for long-term elastocaloric applications and provide a design strategy for developing fatigue-resistant SMAs through microstructural and textural engineering.",

Here, we present a synergistic design that combines covalent crosslinking and silica filler reinforcement to construct a photoactive layer of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with both elevated fracture strain and modulus. This interpenetrating network boosts the crack-onset\u00a0strain to over 40% and raises the modulus by 5-fold to 1090\u2009MPa. The silica filler promotes enhanced aggregation and molecular ordering in both donor and acceptor materials, enabling a power conversion efficiency exceeding 16% for intrinsically stretchable devices, with 80% of the initial efficiency retained under nearly 40% strain, which is one of the highest values reported to date for stretchable OPVs. These findings provide insights for developing stretchable and mechanically robust OPVs towards practical wearable applications.",

Integrating external hydrocyclones into photoreactors is a promising solution, yet the multiscale complexity of hydrocyclone-driven hydrogen generation impedes mechanistic understanding and rational system design. Herein, we build a scalable hydrocyclone-based photoreactor that achieves 270\u2009mL/h hydrogen yield and 5.26% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency under simulated sunlight, as 4.5 times higher than static conditions. We develop a hierarchical multiscale model combining computational fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and density functional theory, which connects macro-scale hydrocyclone flow strain to atomic-level photocatalytic processes. Here, we show that shear stress-induced nanoscale lattice restructuring of the catalyst modulates photoexcitation pathways, triggers a threshold-activated catalytic amplification effect, and identifies an optimal flow rate of 20-30\u2009L/min. These findings reveal a multiscale force-chemical coupling mechanism linking reactor-scale hydrocyclone flow fields to lattice-scale strain-driven catalytic enhancement, guiding large-scale photocatalytic hydrogen production.",

    "abstract": "Prior knowledge accelerates subsequent learning of similarly structured problems - a phenomenon termed learning to learn - by forming generalizable neural representations called neural correlates of schema (NCS). However, how the brain exploits stable NCS while remaining flexible towards changes (the stability-plasticity dilemma) remains unclear. Here, we show that the primate brain addresses this dilemma by representing the stable NCS and task-unique changes in a near-orthogonal manner. We analyzed neural activities in the dorsolateral premotor cortex of three male macaques trained to perform a series of visuomotor mapping tasks. By delineating decision and stimulus-related subspaces, we identified NCS within the decision subspace, whose reuse facilitated subsequent learning. In addition, the decision subspace exhibited a near-orthogonal relationship with the stimulus-related subspace, minimizing cross-domain interference. Our results reveal that restricting NCS to specific functional domains can preserve useful knowledge while maintaining near-orthogonality with other subspaces, enabling flexible adaptation to new environments, thereby resolving the stability-plasticity dilemma.",

Using satellite observations, reanalysis, and climate model experiments, we identify Middle East dust emissions as a major external driver of IOD variability. Observational evidence shows that dust over the 1980-2020 period account for ~36% of interannual IOD variance, surpassing El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation as the main driver during boreal autumn. Climate simulations confirm that reduced dust enhances warming in the western Indian Ocean and inducing easterly winds that shoal the eastern thermocline. These anomalies trigger Bjerknes and wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature feedbacks, amplifying a positive IOD pattern, and vice versa. Our findings reveal a powerful dust-IOD teleconnection, highlighting the need to incorporate aerosol forcing into seasonal forecasts and climate projections.",

Over recent decades, the amplitude of the lower-stratospheric QBO has weakened, and in recent years the QBO has experienced unprecedented disruptions. However, the longer-term evolution of the QBO and its impact on tropospheric circulation remain uncertain. Here, based on CMIP6 models with extended projections beyond 2100 and targeted sensitivity experiments, we show that under ongoing global warming, the QBO exhibits a progressively weaker amplitude and shorter period, eventually risking complete disappearance. This is projected to reduce the predictability of 2-3-year climate forecasts in the troposphere. The weakening of the QBO amplitude arises from enhanced tropical upwelling, whereas the shortening of its period results from the combined influence of strengthened upwelling and intensified wave activity. The potential disappearance of the QBO poses new challenges for climate change under high emission.",

Here we investigate whether interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a key antiviral protein deficient in certain human populations, affects interspecies adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. We find that SARS-CoV-2 Beta and Omicron BA.4 variants passaged through IFITM3-deficient versus wild type mice exhibit enhanced replication and pathogenesis in this new host species. These enhancements are associated with amino acid substitutions in the viral genome, suggesting that IFITM3 limits accumulation of adaptive mutations. Mouse-adapted viruses enable comparative studies of variants in mice. Beta causes lung dysfunction and alters cilia-associated gene programs, consistent with broad viral antigen distribution in the lungs. Omicron, which shows mild pathogenicity and upper respiratory tract preference in humans, replicates to high nasal titers while exhibiting limited lung spread and reduced inflammatory responses compared to Beta. Our findings demonstrate that IFITM3 deficiency accelerates SARS-CoV-2 adaptation while preserving pre-existing variant-specific properties, highlighting that host adaptation enhances viral fitness without necessarily overriding intrinsic viral characteristics.",

Here, we propose a hemostatic strategy based on ultrafast self-gelling self-expanding powder of polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyethyleneimine (PEI) and foaming agent, which achieves non-compressible hemorrhage hemostasis through the multiple synergistic effects of expansion plugging, self-gelling adhesion and activating the coagulation factors. The hemostatic powder integrates rapid physical crosslinking with spontaneous gas foaming, exhibits a fast gelation rate, high expansion ratio, strong tissue adhesion, and activation of red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. The optimized formulation (PP/PT5-TXA30) achieves superior hemostatic performance compared to commercial powders in rat liver volumetric defect, femoral artery and vein transection, as well as complete transection of the subclavian artery and vein in rabbits. Notably, in a lethal porcine model of complete subclavian artery and vein transection, PP/PT5-TXA30 achieves superior performance of non-compressible hemorrhage compared to gauze and XStat\u2122.

    "abstract": "Inherited myopathies are genetic disorders characterised by declining motor function due to progressive muscle weakening and wasting. Recently, pathogenic variants in PAX7, the master transcriptional regulator of muscle stem cells, have been associated with myopathies of variable severity, arguing for impaired satellite cell function as the main pathogenic driver. Here, we report the characterisation of two missense PAX7 variants in a patient with asymmetric, progressive muscle weakness affecting facial, upper and lower body muscles, and myopathic changes on muscle pathology. Despite this disorder closely phenocopying the clinical presentation of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), genetic, epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling indicated that FSHD was unlikely. However, exome sequencing revealed two heterozygous variants in PAX7: c.335\u2009C\u2009>\u2009T, (p.Pro112Leu) and c.1328\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A (p.Cys443Tyr). Modelling these PAX7 variants in human myoblasts resembled the transcriptomic findings found in the muscle biopsy from the patient. Specifically, these PAX7 variants caused upregulation of splicing factors, an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels and reduced cell proliferation. The phenotypic cell changes caused by the PAX7 variants support a pathomechanism whereby diminished satellite cell function impairs muscle homoeostasis. Together, multimodal investigation suggests that these variants in PAX7 are likely causative of an FSHD-like autosomal recessive myopathy and expand the spectrum of neuromuscular disorders originating from impaired satellite cell function.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration is a hallmark of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, yet the transcriptional mechanisms that drive stress-induced neuronal apoptosis remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify the developmental transcription factor PAX6 as an aberrantly sustained and stress-responsive regulator in mature retinal neurons. Upon NMDA-induced excitotoxic stress, PAX6 is phosphorylated by the neuronal stress kinase JNK3, without changes in total expression levels. In vitro kinase assays confirm direct phosphorylation of PAX6 by JNK3, while genetic ablation of JNK3 abolishes PAX6 activation. This phosphorylation enhances PAX6 chromatin binding and enables its co-recruitment with JNK3 to promoters of pro-apoptotic genes, including Bax and Gadd45a. Genome-wide ChIP-seq and transcriptomic analyses reveal that PAX6 and JNK3 form a transcriptional complex that drives apoptotic gene expression. In vivo, AAV-shRNA-mediated knockdown of either PAX6 or JNK3 significantly attenuates excitotoxic RGC death. These findings define a previously unrecognized transcriptional mechanism by which JNK3-mediated phosphorylation of persistently expressed PAX6 converts a developmental factor into a driver of neuronal apoptosis. More broadly, this study highlights how the dysregulation of developmental transcriptional programs in postmitotic neurons can contribute to neurodegeneration, offering new mechanistic insights into stress-induced neuronal loss in chronic neurodegenerative diseases.",

This study evaluated VTE incidence during (neo)adjuvant therapy for resectable and borderline resectable PDAC and its relation to survival.\nThis study included patients from the investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized controlled phase III PREOPANC-2 trial. Patients were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin followed by surgery (FFX arm) or neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT), followed by surgery and adjuvant gemcitabine (CRT arm). VTE was defined as both incidental and symptomatic lower- or upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), splanchnic vein thrombosis, and catheter-related thrombosis. VTE occurrence was retrospectively evaluated from random assignment to 12 months after random assignment. The association with overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Cox regression analysis.\nVTE was diagnosed in 28 of 325 patients (9%): nine (3%) preoperatively and 19 (8%) postoperatively. Most VTEs were symptomatic (54%). Although a higher proportion of patients developed postoperative VTE in the CRT arm (FFX 3% \nVTE occurred in 9% of patients with (borderline) resectable PDAC undergoing (neo)adjuvant treatment in the year after random assignment and was associated with decreased OS. These results underscore the need for standardized reporting of thromboembolic events in clinical trials and future studies assessing the potential benefits of thromboprophylaxis during neoadjuvant therapy.",

    "title": "Cellular survivorship bias as a mechanistic driver of muscle stem cell aging.",
    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by a decline in the ability of tissue repair and regeneration after injury. In skeletal muscle, this decline is largely driven by impaired function of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to efficiently contribute to muscle regeneration. We uncovered a cause of this aging-associated dysfunction: a cellular survivorship bias that prioritizes stem cell persistence at the expense of functionality. With age, MuSCs increased expression of a tumor suppressor, N-myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), which, by suppressing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, increased their long-term survival potential but at the cost of their ability to promptly activate and contribute to muscle regeneration. This delayed muscle regeneration with age may result from a trade-off that favors long-term stem cell survival over immediate regenerative capacity.",

We identified core regulators of cell identity and developed sequence-based models that revealed conserved regulatory codes. By predicting chromatin accessibility across 240 mammalian species, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of human cis-regulatory elements, identifying sets associated with positive selection and gene expression changes, including the recent gain of ",

Understanding how sequence variation sculpts the energetic landscapes underlying these properties requires methods that capture both molecular diversity and dynamic behavior. Single-molecule techniques are ideally suited to this task, but conventional formats remain time and cost intensive. Recent breakthroughs have enabled highly multiplexed approaches for observing molecular dynamics across millions of individual molecules representing thousands of sequences or barcoded entities. Though still in development, these methods have begun to bridge sequence, structure, dynamics, and function at scale, opening new opportunities in drug discovery, molecular diagnostics, and functional genomics.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial vascular plants operate under negative water potential, which results in hydraulic tension in the vascular system. Vascular tension varies with transpiration and soil drying and is regulated by stomata, pressure-activated valves on the leaf surface. We hypothesize that soil physical constraints drive convergence in the operational range of leaf vascular tension. Based on a meta analysis of 19 diverse species, we find that stomatal regulation of transpiration is activated when leaf vascular tension reaches a narrow target of 1.3 \u00b1 0.6 megapascals. This value matches the range (1.4 \u00b1 0.6 megapascals) predicted from an optimal soil water extraction model. Optimality in plant vascular tension appears to have evolved by selection for a narrow range of osmotic pressure in the leaves of diverse species growing across variable environments.",

However, current estimates of heritability are low-twin studies show heritability of only 20 to 25%, and recent large pedigree studies suggest it is as low as 6%. Here we show that these estimates are confounded by extrinsic mortality-deaths caused by extrinsic factors such as accidents or infections. We use mathematical modeling and analyses of twin cohorts raised together and apart to correct for this factor, revealing that heritability of human life span due to intrinsic mortality is above 50%. Such high heritability is similar to that of most other complex human traits and to life-span heritability in other species.",

However, contemporary manufacturing strategies, from injection molding to three-dimensional (3D) printing, result in monolithic objects, unable to spatially encode crystallinity. We develop a light-based approach for fabricating mechanically robust polyolefin thermoplastics with microscopic control over crystallinity in 3D space. Light dosage governs polymer stereochemistry giving access to a continuum of materials, from strong rigid plastics, such as high-density polyethylene, to more extensible materials akin to low-density polyethylene, all at the flick of a switch. Leveraging this finding in lithographic grayscale 3D printing enables rapid multimaterial fabrication with voxel-level control over optical and mechanical properties, opening avenues in information storage, soft robotics, and energy damping.",

The peculiar excitation spectrum of the stripe phase, a definite footprint of its supersolidity, has been difficult to measure experimentally. In this work, we performed in situ imaging of the stripes and directly observed both superfluid and crystal excitations. We investigated superfluid hydrodynamics and revealed a stripe compression mode, thus demonstrating that the system possesses a compressible crystalline structure. Through the frequency softening of this mode, we located the supersolid transition point. Our results establish spin-orbit-coupled supersolids as ideal systems to investigate supersolidity and its rich dynamics.",

We present a high-resolution geodetic velocity field of the Tibetan Plateau, which shows that a few major strike-slip fault systems separate regions of more uniformly distributed deformation. We suggest that focused strain on major fault systems is enabled by relatively low-viscosity ductile shear zones extending through the lithosphere beneath the seismically active fault planes. Simple model calculations show that high slip rates on the Kunlun Fault enable east-west extension to be distributed broadly across the relatively weak southern and central Tibetan Plateau. Activation of the Kunlun fault in the Miocene at the same time as the onset of rifting in the north-south grabens suggests a causal relationship.",

Integrating high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking and video footage from large-scale foraging competitions with cognitive-computational modeling and agent-based simulations, we show how foragers integrate personal, social, and ecological information to guide spatial search and patch-leaving decisions. We show how the social context emerges as a key driver of foraging dynamics. Foragers adaptively rely on social information to locate resources when unsuccessful and extend giving-up times in the presence of others, which results in increased area-restricted search at high social densities. These findings demonstrate the importance of sociality for human foraging decisions and provide a template for harnessing high-resolution tracking data to study real-world cognition.",

    "abstract": "Amide bond formation is widely used in pharmaceutical synthesis, typically involving stoichiometric coupling reagents to activate carboxylic acid substrates for a condensation reaction. As an alternative approach, we repurposed aldehyde dehydrogenases into oxidative amidases by creating a more hydrophobic and spacious catalytic pocket for amines to capture the thioester intermediate. This biocatalyst efficiently facilitates the formation of amide bonds between diverse aldehydes and amines. We also developed a two-step enzymatic cascade to synthesize amides from broadly available aliphatic alcohols. This biocatalytic strategy enabled the redesign of synthetic routes for five drug molecules. Our findings highlight the potential of oxidative amidases in advancing the synthesis of structurally diverse drug molecules through efficient amide bond formation.",

We sequenced eight new Blattodea species showing stepwise contracted genomes. Woodroach brood-rearing remained constrained by deactivated oxidative phosphorylation and peroxisome genes, consistent with slow immature growth. Termites lost key genes mediating sperm motility, corroborating that reproductive division of labor required monogamous colony-founding. They also co-opted many genes from fundamental nutrition-sensitive juvenile hormone, insulin, EGFR and Dpp signaling pathways. Thus, most larvae develop as workers via high energy metabolism early on, while reproductive nymphs highly express energy metabolism genes late in development. These pathways are consistent with obligate dependence on provisioning by specialized workers and feedback loops allowing large homeostatic colonies to evolve.",

Although MutS homolog 2 (MSH2) is a key component of the MMR system and is dysregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the molecular mechanism of MSH2 in the process of HCC development under chronic inflammatory conditions remains unclear. To investigate the function of MSH2 in inflammation-associated hepatocarcinogenesis, we treated hepatocyte-specific Msh2-knockout (Msh2 KO) mice with 0.02% thioacetamide for 30 weeks to induce chronic liver inflammation and examined their phenotype. Msh2 KO mice exhibited higher liver tumor incidence than wild-type mice, with no major differences in inflammation or fibrosis. Whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed that genetic alterations with defective MMR-associated signatures were increased in Msh2 KO tumors, though no common cancer driver genes were identified. Transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of cell cycle-related gene sets, including the G2M checkpoint and E2F targets. Functional assays further demonstrated that MSH2 downregulation impaired ATM-CHK2-mediated DNA damage response and promoted cell cycle acceleration. MSH2 exerts its tumor-suppressive effects in hepatocytes not only through canonical MMR but also by regulating the cell cycle via the ATM-CHK2 axis.",

Little is known about the impact of spatial structure, in particular the topology of connections among subpopulations, on adaptive evolution. Typically, spatial structure slows adaptation, although some models suggest topologies that concentrate dispersing individuals through a central hub can accelerate adaptation above that of a well-mixed system. We provide evidence to support this claim and show acceleration is accompanied by high rates of parallel evolution. Our results suggest metapopulation topology can be a potent force driving evolutionary dynamics and patterns of genomic repeatability in structured landscapes such as those involving the spread of pathogens or invasive species.",

    "abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) research has traditionally investigated task processing using static blocked or event-related designs. Consequently, our understanding of threat processing remains limited to findings from paradigms with restricted dynamics. In this paper, we applied switching linear dynamical systems (SLDSs) to uncover the dynamics of threat processing during a continuous threat-of-shock paradigm. Unlike typical systems neuroscience studies that assume systems are decoupled from external inputs, we characterized both endogenous and exogenous contributions to the dynamics. We first demonstrated that the SLDS model learned the regularities of the experimental paradigm; states and state transitions estimated from fMRI data across 85 regions of interest reflected both threat proximity and direction (approach vs. retreat). After establishing that the model captured key properties of threat-related processing, we characterized the dynamics of states and their transitions. The results reveal how threat processing can be viewed as dynamic multivariate patterns whose trajectories are determined by intrinsic and extrinsic factors that jointly drive how the brain temporally evolves. Furthermore, we developed a measure of region importance to quantify individual brain region contributions to system dynamics, complementing the system-level SLDS formalism. Finally, we demonstrated that an SLDS model trained on one paradigm successfully generalizes to a separate experiment, capturing fMRI dynamics across distinct threat-processing tasks. We propose that viewing threat processing through the lens of dynamical systems offers vital avenues to uncover properties of threat dynamics not unveiled by standard experimental designs.",

Twenty-seven patients were randomized 2:1 into two cohorts: Delta-24-RGD (via standard biopsy needle) with IFN-\u1d6fE or Delta-24-RGD alone (via standard biopsy needle). In an expansion cohort, 10 patients received intra-tumorally injected Delta-24-RGD via the MEMS Cannula.\nAlthough the addition of IFN-\u1d6fE to Delta-24-RGD did not significantly increase the percentage of long term survivors compared with Delta-24-RGD alone, the IFN-\u1d6fE cohort had the longest-surviving patients (OS 44.2, 23.7, 20.6 and 20.1 months). Post-hoc analysis of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Viral Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing Antibody Reactome profiling of viral epitopes (VirScan) and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) revealed that levels of circulating anti-adenovirus specific IgG and CD8+ NKT-like cells 2 months after treatment with Delta-24-RGD distinguished long-term survivors from short-term survivors.\nImmunological fitness, assessed by an anti-adenoviral specific antibody response and higher levels of activated CD8+ NKT-like cells after Delta-24-RGD treatment, may have utility as an early surrogate of a robust systemic immune response that correlates with long-term survival.",

Eligible patients achieving a response to the most recent platinum therapy received daily niraparib and triweekly bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate, analyzed using Simon's two-stage design with adaptive statistical inference.\nThe primary endpoint was met, with 26 of 44 patients (59.1%) remaining progression-free at 6 months. The estimated 6-month PFS rate was 68% [95% confidence interval (CI), 55%-85%], and the median PFS was 11.5 months [95% CI, 7.9-not reached]. Subgroup analyses suggested greater benefit in patients with a longer treatment-free interval after the penultimate chemotherapy and in those who achieved a complete response to the most recent chemotherapy. Grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 27.3% of patients, with no treatment-related deaths or new safety signals observed.\nThis is the first report of PARPi rechallenge with bevacizumab as maintenance therapy in this setting. The combination demonstrated promising efficacy, particularly in patients with favorable platinum responsiveness, and warrants further investigation in biomarker-driven studies.",

    "abstract": "The rapid and sustained proliferation of cancer cells necessitates increased protein production, which, along with their disrupted metabolism, elevates the likelihood of translation errors. Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a recently identified mechanism, mitigates ribosome collisions resulting from frequent translation stalls. However, the precise pathophysiological role of the RQC pathway in oncogenesis remains ambiguous. Our research centered on the pathogenic implications of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing), a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The presence of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins was observed commonly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The exogenous introduction of the mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5\u03b1) protein, accompanied by artificial CAT-tail mimicking sequences, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and inhibited the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). These alterations in mitochondrial characteristics provided resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Consequently, msiCAT-tailing can foster cell survival and migration, whereas blocking msiCAT-tailing via genetic or pharmacological intervention can impede GBM cell overgrowth.",

    "abstract": "Motility endows microorganisms with the ability to swim to nutrient-rich environments, but many species are sessile. Existing hydrodynamic arguments in support of either strategy, to swim or to attach and generate feeding currents, are often built on a limited set of experimental or modeling assumptions. Here, to assess the hydrodynamics of these 'swim' or 'stay' strategies, we propose a comprehensive methodology that combines mechanistic modeling with a survey of published shape and flow data in ciliates. Model predictions and empirical observations show small variations in feeding rates in favor of either motile or sessile cells. Case-specific variations notwithstanding, our overarching analysis shows that flow physics imposes no constraint on the feeding rates that are achievable by the swimming versus sessile strategies - they can both be equally competitive in transporting nutrients and wastes to and from the cell surface within flow regimes typically experienced by ciliates. Our findings help resolve a long-standing dilemma of which strategy is hydrodynamically optimal and explain patterns occurring in natural communities that alternate between free swimming and temporary attachments. Importantly, our findings indicate that the evolutionary pressures that shaped these strategies acted in concert with, not against, flow physics.",

Fusion of satellite cell-derived myoblasts (SCMs) is indispensable for generating the multinucleated, contractile myofibers during muscle repair. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain incompletely understood. Here, we reveal a critical role for branched actin polymerization in SCM fusion during mouse skeletal muscle regeneration. Using conditional knockouts of the Arp2/3 complex and its actin nucleation-promoting factors N-WASP and WAVE, we demonstrate that branched actin polymerization is specifically required for SCM fusion but dispensable for satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We show that the N-WASP and WAVE complexes have partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion and that branched actin polymerization is essential for generating invasive protrusions at fusogenic synapses in SCMs. Together, our study identifies branched-actin regulators as key components of the myoblast fusion machinery and establishes invasive protrusion formation as a critical mechanism enabling myoblast fusion during skeletal muscle regeneration.",

    "title": "AACRNL evolved from virulence factor to epigenetic parasite driving genome expansion in free-living eukaryotes.",
    "abstract": "Crinkler effectors are iconic toxins deployed by pathogens to suppress host immunity, a function long thought exclusive to pathogenic species. Here, we uncover a striking evolutionary twist: an ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein that has repurposed its toxin-derived activity to function as an epigenetic parasite in free-living eukaryotes, challenging the paradigm that Crinkler effectors are exclusively pathogen-restricted virulence factors. The ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein retains a functional mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase domain homologous to diphtheria toxin, yet exhibits degeneration of N-terminal host-targeting domain, severing ties to canonical pathogenic functions. This activity enables dual subversion of host mechanisms: the ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein mono-ADP-ribosylates the EZH2, reducing H3K27me3-mediated silencing and reactivating its own locus and adjacent transposons to drive replicative amplification; simultaneously, it modifies the immune adaptor TRAF6, suppressing NF-\u03baB and IRF3 pathways to weaken innate immune surveillance and facilitate sustained propagation within the host genome. Notably, this parasitic strategy is countered by host detoxification: TRAF6 ubiquitinates ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Together, our findings reveal how a toxin-derived effector escaped pathogenic contexts to evolve as a selfish genomic element, leveraging toxin-like activity to subvert epigenetic and immune barriers and redefining the evolutionary potential of Crinkler toxins as drivers of genomic conflict beyond pathogenicity.",

    "title": "Prenatal Zika virus exposure disrupts social-emotional development and cortical visual function in infant macaques.",
    "abstract": "Prenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure can result in outcomes ranging from severe birth defects to subtle developmental delays, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a translational rhesus macaque model, we assess visual, auditory, and neurodevelopmental outcomes through 12 months of age following first-trimester ZIKV inoculation. Pregnant macaques, either flavivirus-naive or with prior dengue virus (DENV) exposure, are inoculated with Asian or African ZIKV lineages. Maternal viremia duration, placental viral burden, and neutralizing antibody titers vary but are not associated with developmental outcomes. At 12 months, ZIKV-exposed infants exhibit altered maternal attachment behaviors and reduced inhibition toward novel sensory stimuli. Visual evoked potentials are impaired at 3 months but normalize by 12 months; hearing loss is more frequent but not statistically significant. These outcomes are driven by ZIKV exposure itself, independent of maternal infection characteristics. Our findings highlight the limitations of maternal biomarkers in risk prediction and support incorporating infant-focused developmental outcomes in studies of maternal interventions.",

    "title": "Extreme plate boundary localization promotes shallow earthquake slip at the Japan Trench.",
    "abstract": "The 2011 moment magnitude 9.1 Tohoku-oki earthquake is exceptional among great earthquakes for having peak slip of ~50 to 70 meters on the shallowest portion of the plate boundary megathrust. Drill cores and geophysical logs from International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 405 demonstrate that the megathrust preferentially develops at the top or base of the pelagic clay in the sedimentary layers present on the incoming Pacific Plate, where pronounced contrasts in physical properties occur. This preference results in a narrow, weak fault located at a major mechanical contact between frontal prism mud and subducted sediments, which enhances the tendency for shallow seismic slip, suggesting that the Japan Trench may be more susceptible to ruptures with large shallow slip than are margins without weak clays.",
