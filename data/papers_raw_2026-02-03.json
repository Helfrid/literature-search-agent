    "abstract": "Tauopathy, including Alzheimer's Disease, is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, yet current therapies fail to halt disease progression, partly due to limited understanding of early Tau pathological structures. Cryo-electron microscopy has clarified distinct Tau structures tied to disease phenotypes, but only in their mature forms and at low throughput. Hence, molecular probes that can recognize early Tau conformations in high throughput and in situ hold the potential to transform our understanding of Tau aggregation. Tau undergoes sequential changes, including hyperphosphorylation and misfolding, with the aggregation-prone PHF6 region in R3 shown to drive its self-assembly and fibrillar core formation. In this study, we used existing and novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to map the Tau protein in AD and other Tauopathies. The conformation-specific antibody 16B12, targeting the R1-R3 regions, showed high sensitivity in detecting early Tau structures and inhibited seed-induced aggregation in vitro. Another antibody, 9H6F2, detected P1-P2 interactions and functioned as a pan-biomarker across Tauopathies. Our findings underscore the critical role of early P1-P2 and R1-R3 interactions in Tau fibril maturation, and our mAbs show promise as early diagnostic markers for Tau-related neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs in diverse conditions, including aging, disuse, cancer cachexia, and chronic disease. It results from an imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation, where excessive proteolysis drives loss of contractile proteins, weakness, and metabolic decline. Recent advances in structural biology, multi-omics approaches, and high-resolution imaging have uncovered how sarcomeric and cytoskeletal components are gradually degraded by ubiquitin ligases, proteasomes, and autophagy. Mechanical loading and mechanotransduction emerge as key regulators of proteostasis, linking tension to anabolic signaling. Transcriptional and epigenetic control through IGF1-Akt-mTOR, TGF-\u03b2, inflammatory cytokines, and circadian rhythms as well as non-coding RNAs and miRNAs also contribute to wasting. This review summarizes these recent findings, and novel therapeutic strategies such as restoring mitochondrial function and modulating RNA networks and mechanosensitive signaling to preserve muscle mass and function.",

The impact of adaptations to the fluid microenvironment of the circulation on the outcome of the metastatic cascade is not well understood. Here, we find that cancer cells exposed to brief pulses of high-level fluid shear stress (FSS) exhibit enhanced invasiveness and anchorage-independent proliferation in vitro and enhanced metastatic colonization/tumor formation in vivo. Cancer cells exposed to FSS rapidly alter their metabolism in a manner that promotes survival by providing energy for cytoskeletal remodeling and contractility as well as reducing equivalents to counter oxidative stress associated with cell detachment. Thus, exposure to FSS may provide CTCs with an unexpected survival benefit that promotes metastatic colonization.",

Yet, how these cells interpret external cues to guide their migration is not fully understood. We investigate this question using retinal horizontal cells as a model. Combining transcriptomics, targeted CRISPR screening, and live imaging, we reveal the spatiotemporal guidance system underlying horizontal cell lamination: repulsive Slit1b/2-Robo2 signaling in the amacrine cell layer initiates apical horizontal cell migration, while attractive neurturin-Gfr\u03b11/2 signaling from photoreceptors fine-tunes final positioning beneath the photoreceptor layer. Disruption of these pathways causes basal retention of horizontal cells, highlighting the importance of spatially coordinated signaling for proper lamination and functional retinal circuitry. Our results uncover how positional signals and tissue architecture cooperate to achieve neuronal migration precision, a principle likely relevant across the developing central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Abortive infection systems protect bacteria by triggering self-destruction in response to phage attack. Most known systems rely on stable cyclic nucleotides that accumulate to stoichiometric levels to activate effectors; the Kongming (Kom) system employs the toxic metabolite deoxyinosine triphosphate (dITP) as its signaling molecule. Here, we show that the Escherichia coli KomB-KomC (KomBC) complex forms a preassembled filament that remains inactive until dITP binding induces cooperative allosteric activation. KomB, a homolog of the nucleotide-hydrolyzing enzyme HAM1, has lost catalytic activity but evolved a high-affinity, hydrolysis-resistant binding pocket for dITP. Interestingly, substoichiometric dITP binding is sufficient to activate adjacent KomC NADase domains, which propagate activation cooperatively along the filament. This filament-based architecture enables ultrasensitive, long-range allosteric signaling in response to a low-abundance and short-lived metabolite. Our findings reveal an ultrasensitive immune strategy that transforms a toxic byproduct into a robust antiviral trigger, expanding the known repertoire of bacterial defense strategies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms underlying homeostatic sleep regulation is a central, unmet goal of sleep science. Our comprehension of such regulation in mammals has required recognizing distinct sleep stages. Drosophila melanogaster is an important genetic model system for studying sleep. Since the discovery of sleep-like states in the fly 25 years ago, the field has treated sleep as a unitary state consisting of any inactivity lasting 5 min or longer, despite convergent work suggesting the existence of multiple sleep states. Here, we establish that three distinct sleep states in flies can be classified based on simple inactivity duration criteria. We show that the daily initiation of these sleep states is temporally distinct, with long sleep occurring immediately following the largest daily period of wakefulness. We also report that the rebound in response to mechanical sleep deprivation is present only in long sleep and comes at the expense of shorter sleep states. Deprivation-induced decreases in shorter sleep states obscure homeostatic sleep rebound, but only when sleep is measured using traditional methods. We observe distinctly timed ultradian oscillations of fly sleep states, reminiscent of mammalian sleep cycles. Our results indicate that the recognition of such sleep states will be necessary to fully realize the promise of the Drosophila model system for identifying conserved genetic mechanisms underlying sleep regulation.",

    "abstract": "Flies, like vertebrates, preserve the spatial organization of visual input through axonal projections into the brain, a principle called retinotopy. The best-known developmental mechanisms for retinotopy are molecular gradients in the target regions, yet Drosophila photoreceptors can form retinotopic maps ectopically in wrong brain regions. We show that a temporal gradient of axonal growth plus selective adhesion between photoreceptor axons precisely preserves the cellular eye pattern. Each of the 800 single eyes, the ommatidia, form a bundle of six axons that are held in place by inter-bundle adhesion through the protocadherin Flamingo and preserve their intra-bundle organization through the adhesion molecule Sidekick. Computational modeling of axon terminals as selectively adhesive soft bodies in a developmental wave generates the retinotopic pattern, including the shapes of the postsynaptic lamina neurons, which emerge without explicit encoding. Hence, a temporal gradient and two adhesive forces can ensure retinotopic map formation without a target-derived mechanism. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria contain a genome (mtDNA) encoding a handful of proteins essential for cellular respiration. mtDNA can leak into the cytosol and drive fitness defects. The first genes associated with mtDNA escape were discovered in yeast and aptly named \"yeast mitochondrial escape\" (YME) genes. We identify the mechanism by which an intermembrane space nuclease, endonuclease G (human ENDOG; yeast Nuc1), prevents mtDNA escape to the cytosol in yeast. Nuc1 nuclease activity and mitochondrial localization are essential for preventing mtDNA escape and suggest a direct role of Nuc1 in degrading mtDNA bound for escape. We find that blocking autophagy via atg1 and atg8 mutants prevents mtDNA escape in the absence of Nuc1. We further demonstrate that blocking mitophagy via atg11 and atg32 mutants prevents mtDNA escape, whereas inducing mitophagy increases mtDNA escape in the absence of Nuc1. Finally, we demonstrate that Nuc1 degrades mtDNA bound for escape via the vacuole, as an atg15 mutant that prevents disassembly of autophagic bodies in the vacuole also prevents mtDNA escape. Overall, our results implicate vacuolar entry of mitochondria during mitophagy as an important mtDNA escape pathway in yeast, which is normally mitigated via the degradation of mtDNA by Nuc1.",

    "abstract": "Tightly regulated autophagy is essential in eukaryotes, and this pathway is stimulated by cellular and environmental stresses. In plants, salt stress-induced autophagy crucially functions in building salt tolerance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely enigmatic. This study reveals that salt stress triggers specific mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, which, through phosphorylation, stimulates the assembly of autophagy initiation complexes to promote salt tolerance in maize. Salt-activated ZmMPK6 phosphorylates ZmATG101 at an evolutionarily deeply conserved Ser-190. Phosphorylation of S190 functions as a molecular switch through controlling the formation of ZmATG101-ZmATG11a complexes for autophagy initiation. Consistently, mutants lacking ZmMPK6, ZmATG101, or ZmATG11a exhibit compromised autophagy induction and salt tolerance. Thus, this study discovers a fundamental mechanism for autophagy initiation regulation through ATG101 scaffold phosphorylation and defines a MAPK-ATG101-ATG11 module as governing plant salt tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and clinically significant cardiac rhythm disturbance, is associated with gut microbial dysbiosis. However, the precise role of the microbiota and associated metabolism in this condition remain unclear. Through integrated analysis of clinical cohorts and multiple animal models, we identified an intestinal symbiont, Ruminococcus gnavus (R. gnavus), which suppresses the occurrence of AF and atrial fibrosis by producing the leucine-derived branched-chain fatty acid isovaleric acid (IVA). R. gnavus colonization or exogenous IVA supplementation reduced AF susceptibility and improved fibrosis-driven atrial remodeling. Mechanistically, R. gnavus metabolizes dietary leucine into IVA through its unique enzyme 2-oxoisovalerate ferredoxin reductase \u03b3-subunit (vorC). Microbiome-derived IVA activates G protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A) on atrial cardiomyocytes, inhibiting interleukin (IL)-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling activation and blocking gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis through a STAT3-GSDME feedforward circuit. These results reveal that the microbial metabolism of dietary leucine and the production of IVA play pivotal roles in preventing AF onset and progression.",

Through integrative lactylome and proteome profiling, we delineate the global landscape of protein lysine lactylation in bladder cancer, identifying lysine (K)47 and K50 of Rho guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor \u03b2 (ARHGDIB) as lactylation sites. Histone deacetylase (HDAC)2-mediated delactylation abrogates the tumor-suppressive function of ARHGDIB, promoting metastasis and cisplatin resistance of bladder cancer. Mechanistically, delactylation of ARHGDIB attenuates its binding affinity for Rac1, facilitating Rac1 membrane translocation and activation. This enhances DNA damage repair through the Rac1-MRN-ATM-CHK2 axis. Clinically, reduced ARHGDIB-K50 lactylation levels correlate with cisplatin resistance and poor prognosis. Entinostat, an inhibitor of class I HDAC, synergizes with cisplatin by preventing ARHGDIB delactylation. Collectively, our findings unveil a unique paradigm in which delactylation of tumor suppressors drives metastasis and chemoresistance.

Severing the input to the sympathetic ganglia or ablating the vagus nerve revealed that the threat-related changes to behavioral state do not require interoceptive pathways. Direct tachycardic optopacing of the heart similarly suppressed the OMR response, but by reducing cardiac filling during diastole, thereby impacting oxygen delivery to the CNS. Optopacing also changed the activity of specific brain regions but in neurons distinct from those associated with threat-induced tachycardia. These cardiac function-associated central changes may have relevance to autonomic imbalances in anxiety, stress, and orthostatic disorders.",

We show that nematode invasion activates plant defense gene expression but concurrently disrupts rhizosphere homeostasis, resulting in microbiome dysbiosis that overrides host resistance. Meloidogyne invasion induces pronounced metabolic reprogramming, characterized by depletion of tomatidine and accumulation of carbohydrate metabolites such as galactose. These shifts selectively suppress Streptomyces-dominated antagonistic microbiota while enriching Acidovorax, which exhibits nutritional synergy with Ralstonia. Using synthetic microbial community transplantation, we demonstrate a functional transition from pathogen-suppressive to pathogen-permissive bacteriomes following nematode invasion. Together, our findings reveal how nematodes and bacterial pathogens cooperatively subvert plant-microbe metabolic signaling to undermine rhizosphere immunity, highlighting actionable targets for microbiome-based disease control.",

    "abstract": "Copper (Cu) is essential for innate immunity; however, how neutrophils regulate Cu homeostasis to support their functions remains unclear. We found that myeloid progenitors express abundant Cu-transporter ATP7B targeted to distinct vesicles and store Cu in vesicles. During neutrophil differentiation, ATP7B is downregulated, whereas ATP7A, LOXL2, and SLC31A2 are induced, suggesting a coordinated switch from Cu storage to utilization. As mature neutrophils exit the bone marrow, cellular Cu levels drop markedly, indicating Cu release during late maturation or egress. Myeloid-specific deletion of Atp7b in mice uncouples lineage commitment from functional maturation: Atp7b-deficient cells differentiate into neutrophils but fail to mature fully, showing more mitochondria, fewer lysosome-like structures, lower abundance of Cebp-\u03b5 and Ngal, reduced tubulin levels, and disrupted microtubules. Following lipopolysaccharide injection, Atp7b-deficient bone marrow releases fewer neutrophils into the bloodstream. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of the Cu-transport network in neutrophil maturation and egress.",

    "title": "Transcriptomic analysis of non-model Drosophilidae reveals novel AMP candidates.",
    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster has been a valuable model for dissecting the molecular architecture of innate immunity. However, the family Drosophilidae encompasses over 4000 species, spanning deep evolutionary divergences and diverse ecologies. Here, we use immune challenge with the Gram-negative pathogen Providencia rettgeri to investigate the conservation and evolution of immune responses in three non-model drosophilid species that diverged from D. melanogaster over 45 million years ago-Hirtodrosophila cameraria, H. confusa, and Scaptodrosophila deflexa.\nWe find that all three species retain a core set of immune signaling and recognition genes, but exhibit substantial variation in effector gene content and inducibility. In particular, Scaptodrosophila deflexa lacks orthologs of multiple antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) known from D. melanogaster, including DptA, AttA, and AttC, and shows little transcriptional response to bacterial challenge with Providencia rettgeri. In contrast, both of the Hirtodrosophila species exhibit substantial transcriptional responses, including strong induction of canonical Imd pathway genes. Microbiome profiling of our samples revealed higher Providencia abundance in H. cameraria, and high levels of the defensive symbiont Spiroplasma in S. deflexa-potentially explaining differences in infection outcome. Our combined annotation and expression analysis of these species also allowed us to identify 20 novel AMP-like candidates, many with structural features like known AMPs.\nOur study demonstrates the feasibility of functional immune analyses in non-model Drosophila species and reveals striking lineage-specific differences in immune gene repertoire and expression. These findings highlight the importance of non-model, wild-derived samples for uncovering novel immune effectors and understanding evolutionary forces shaping insect immunity.",

    "abstract": "Hexadecanamide (HEX) has been recognized for its significant anti-inflammatory properties. However, its specific role and underlying mechanisms in the context of colitis remain poorly understood.\nHerein, we first determined the effect of oral HEX on DSS-induced colitis in mice. Our results showed that HEX alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice, which was related to the improvement of intestinal barrier integrity and the reduction of colonic inflammatory responses. Interestingly, HEX suppressed the initiation of DSS-induced ferroptosis. In detail, HEX inhibited autophagy and ferritinophagy, which subsequently blocked lipid peroxidation. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that HEX intervention regulated the gut microbial composition, characterized by an increased relative abundance of Actinobacteriota and Patescibacteria and a decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes. To validate these findings, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed in DSS-treated mice. The microbiota derived from HEX-treated mice exhibited greater efficacy in alleviating colitis compared to that from control-treated mice, as evidenced by prominent anti-inflammatory effects and colonic barrier repair, and consistent alterations in the gut microbial community, which were further confirmed by FMT.\nOverall, our findings suggest that HEX markedly ameliorates DSS-induced colitis by limiting inflammation, improving barrier integrity and regulating gut microbial composition. These results highlight the critical role of HEX in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and suggest its potential as a novel preventive and therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi), a naturally occurring gene silencing mechanism found in almost all eukaryotic organisms, has proven to be an adaptable and powerful tool in therapeutics, bioengineering, and agriculture. Differential responses to RNAi, however, are a key limiting factor, in which cellular uptake of exogenous dsRNA in target organisms remains poorly understood.\nHere, to fill this knowledge gap, we integrated omics tools with phenotypic assays to characterize dsRNA uptake mechanisms across tissues in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria (Orthoptera). Our findings clearly demonstrate that cellular uptake of dsRNA is tissue-dependent, involving multiple cell membrane receptors and pathways. In hemocytes, uptake is rapid and mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Epidermal cells utilize clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, while midgut cells employ caveolin-mediated endocytosis and Sid-like channel transport. Comparatively, clathrin-mediated endocytosis appears to be the most conserved mechanism across insects, including the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera), and the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Lepidoptera).\nTaken together, dsRNA enters the cells of different tissue types through diverse pathways. This systematic and comprehensive study not only advances our understanding of the cellular uptake of extracellular dsRNA and the resultant differential sensitivity to RNAi in insects, but also facilitates the ongoing integration of this species-specific biotechnology into sustainable integrated pest management practices.",

    "abstract": "Blebs are membrane protrusions formed when localized regions of the plasma membrane detach from the actin cortex, enabling outward expansion driven by intracellular pressure. These structures play critical roles in cell migration and proliferation. While cortical actin contraction has been proposed as the primary driver of cytoplasmic fluid influx during bleb expansion, our prior observations revealed compartmentalization of Ca\u00b2\u207a ions and specific proteins (e.g., Mena) within expanding blebs. The functional significance of these components remained unresolved. In this study, we demonstrate that elevated Ca\u00b2\u207a levels during bleb expansion induce the assembly of a protein superstructure built around the CaMKII holoenzyme, incorporating Mena and other regulatory proteins. This complex exhibits intrinsic osmotic activity, facilitating water influx and directly contributing to bleb expansion. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism underlying bleb expansion and provide new insights into the dynamic regulation of physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila Toll/NF-\u03baB pathway has been extensively studied for its roles in innate immunity and embryonic development. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms underlying Spz/Toll signaling in non-immune contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for Toll in regulating intestinal stem cell activity through direct transcriptional control of PI3K and Akt in an insulin-independent manner. Time-series transcriptomic analysis of intestinal damage and repair responses reveals that the stress-responsive factor Jumu regulates Spz expression to activate Toll signaling. Disruption of the Jumu/Spz/Toll cascade or PI3K/Akt signaling impairs intestinal regeneration and suppresses tumor growth, and epistasis analysis confirms that PI3K/Akt functions downstream of Toll. Our findings elucidate an autocrine Spz/Toll-mediated mechanism that drives stem cell function via the PI3K/Akt pathway during tissue homeostasis and uncover a critical non-immune role of Toll signaling in both physiological and pathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "The transmembrane protein CMTM6 promotes plasma membrane expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1, a key suppressor of anti-tumor immunity. Targeting CMTM6 has been proposed as a strategy to enhance tumor cell killing by reducing PD-L1 surface expression. In accord, ablation of CMTM6 in mouse cancer models was shown to efficiently suppress tumor growth, but unexpectedly in a manner partially independent of PD-L1, suggesting that CMTM6 may regulate additional proteins involved in anti-tumor immunity. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that mouse CMTM6 strongly associates with the cell death receptor FAS and negatively regulates its surface expression in mice. Deletion of CMTM6 increases FAS plasma membrane localization and sensitizes murine cells to FAS ligand-induced cytotoxicity. However, the interaction between CMTM6 and FAS is absent in human cells due to the difference in three amino acids at the boundary of the FAS extracellular and transmembrane domains. Altogether, our findings urge caution when translating promising data regarding the targeting of CMTM6 from mouse cancer models to potential human therapies.",

These circuits influence malignant, stromal, and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, as well as systemic immune and metabolic processes. In this review, we synthesize current findings on brain-periphery neural networks across multiple cancer types and discuss how tumor burden can reshape brain activity, contributing to emotional and cognitive disturbances, and how the brain, in turn, regulates tumor biology. In particular, we address the translational potential of targeting brain-tumor circuits via neuromodulation, behavioral interventions, and lifestyle-based therapies. Understanding these bidirectional communications offers new approaches for systemic, integrative therapeutic strategies.",

Merkel cells (MCs) are cutaneous mechanosensors. We analyzed full-length transcripts of FACS-sorted single mouse MCs at all stages of development and discovered that their terminal differentiation was accompanied by an emergence of non-coding transcripts associated with genes related to MC function. Non-coding RNAs upregulated during terminal differentiation included retained intron transcripts capable of forming nuclear condensates that contained their cognate mRNAs. We showed that Aspa retained intron condensates prevented the nuclear export of Aspa mRNA, reducing ASPA expression. Transcripts associated with terminal differentiation in five other mammalian cell types also showed an increased abundance of non-coding biotypes and this was attenuated in differentiation-defective Down syndrome neurons. These findings strongly suggest that the emergence of non-coding transcripts is a general feature of terminal differentiation and retained intron condensates can function to regulate gene expression.",

    "abstract": "SMAC is a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, which is released during apoptosis and whose known function is antagonism of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins in the cytosol, to facilitate caspase activation. Recent data suggest that SMAC can also be released by sub-lethal signals in the apoptosis pathway, in the absence of cell death. We here explored potential functions of SMAC in non-apoptotic cells. We found that a portion of SMAC is spontaneously released into the cytosol in the absence of apoptosis, regulated by the BCL-2-family proteins BAX and BAK and the fission GTPase DRP1. In cancer cell lines, SMAC was required for the activation of caspases in lethal and non-lethal conditions, while this contribution to caspase-activation was much smaller in non-malignant fibroblast lines. In cells with high levels of cytosolic SMAC, SMAC deficiency reduced in vitro migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth as well as metastasis in a xenograft model in zebrafish. SMAC-deficient cells further showed a reduced activity in interferon signaling, associated with reduced cytosolic presence of mitochondrial DNA and activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STRING), and SMAC expression levels correlated with interferon-induced genes in cancer data sets. We further found that SMAC can regulate mitochondrial morphology and integrity. Finally, high gene-expression of SMAC was associated with poor prognosis in patients of several cancer types. These results identify SMAC as a regulator of inflammation and growth behavior of cancer cells. They further report a mitochondrial function of SMAC and demonstrate a role of SMAC in human cancer biology across several cancer entities.",

However, the mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic effects of their inhibitors remain unclear. Here we identify a critical role for the non-canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1.1 (PRC1.1) in mediating the cellular responses to DOT1L and Menin inhibitors. Menin inhibition induces PRC1.1-dependent deposition of H2AK119ub to silence a subset of MLL-FP targets, whereas DOT1L inhibition results in a genome-wide increase in H2AK119ub. We show that enhanced PRC1.1 activity arises specifically from the progressive loss of DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation, independent of MLL-FP displacement or transcriptional repression. This regulatory crosstalk is conserved across cell types and is driven by direct biochemical antagonism between H3K79 methylation and PRC1 activity. Together, our findings establish DOT1L as a component of transcriptional memory co-opted in leukaemia and suggest it serves as the missing link balancing the opposing forces of the MLL-Polycomb axis.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase (RNAP) must unwind duplex DNA prior to transcription initiation. In bacteria, unwinding starts at a DNA motif called the promoter -10 element. Specifically, non-template strand bases interact with RNAP to trigger the process. A protein called CarD can support -10 element opening in many microbes. Whilst this most often activates transcription, CarD may repress if the DNA open complex is too stable. For Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a purple photoheterotrophic alpha-proteobacterium, CarD is particularly important as many -10 elements have a key DNA sequence defect. Here, we use genomic tools to map transcription initiation, binding of RNAP, CarD interactions, and DNA topology, globally in R. sphaeroides. We show an association between CarD-controlled transcription, and negative DNA supercoiling, which alters global gene expression if perturbed. Using biochemical tools, we show that promoter co-regulation by CarD and supercoiling results from the -10 element defect inherent to R. sphaeroides promoters. If this flaw is corrected, regulation by CarD and supercoiling is disrupted. As supercoiling dissipates during stress, we suggest CarD couples housekeeping transcription to the environment via DNA topology.",

Here, we establish a human iPSC-derived cholangiocyte-like cell (CLC) organoid model that can be infected by HCMV, which results in reduced organoid growth, a deformed structure, and a loss of barrier function. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the HCMV-infected organoids had highly enriched expression of genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Importantly, blockade of TGF-\u03b2 signalling abrogates the EMT induction effect in the HCMV-infected CLC organoids. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq indicates that HCMV infection occurred in different clusters with distinct viral and host gene expression profiles and the analysis shows increased expression of EMT and TGF-\u03b2 signalling-related genes.

    "title": "Tuning superelasticity in high entropy alloy via a hidden strain order.",
    "abstract": "Superelasticity - exhibiting either Hookean (linear) or non-Hookean (nonlinear) recoverable strain beyond 2% - has been realized in distinct material systems such as metallic glasses, shape memory alloys, strain glass alloys and Gum metals, enabling diverse technological applications. Here we demonstrate that, through compositional tuning in a high-entropy alloy, the elastic behavior can be continuously and reversibly modulated between Hookean superelasticity, non-Hookean superelasticity with an ultrahigh recoverable strain of ~8%, and back to the Hookean regime. By combining atomic-scale strain mapping and extensive first-principles calculations, we reveal that this tunability is governed by a hidden strain order, arising from frustrated crystallization of two competing phases. As a result, local lattice distortion arises, producing a heterogeneous strain landscape that modulates phase stability, phase transformation propensity, and elastic response. Our findings establish a materials design strategy for programming Hookean and non-Hookean elasticity behavior on demand, with promising applications in microelectromechanical systems, high-precision actuators, and adaptive damping devices.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) involves multiple pathological processes and presents significant clinical challenges in treatment. Traditional therapies focus on individual factors in cartilage, synovium, or subchondral bone, limiting their ability to comprehensively address OA pathogenesis. In this study, a ROS/MMP13 dual-responsive organic selenium hydrogel microsphere (HSPHR) is developed to trigger a localized microenvironmental response specific to early OA by exploiting the disease's pathological features. Simultaneously, the organic selenium component effectively enhances selenoprotein levels in cartilage, synovium, and subchondral bone, enabling multimodal treatment for osteoarthritis. HSPHR injections into joints reduce cartilage damage, synovial hyperplasia, and bone sclerosis in post-traumatic OA, while promoting new cartilage in defect models. It enhances selenoprotein synthesis and activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in key cells, improving mitochondrial function and antioxidant capacity, thus reversing OA-related changes. Here, we present a multimodal therapeutic strategy for OA lesions and reveal shared regulatory pathways among different cell types. This approach offers distinct insights for the multimodal treatment of degenerative joint diseases.",

Here, we realize two- and three-site chains in semiconducting quantum dots coupled via superconductors, and tune them to the sweet spot where zero-energy Majorana modes appear at the chain ends. We demonstrate control of the superconducting phase through both magnetic field and sweet-spot selection, and fully characterize the excitation spectrum under local and global perturbations. All spectral features are identified using the ideal Kitaev chain model. To assess Majorana localization, we couple the system to an additional quantum dot. The absence of energy splitting at the sweet spot is compatible with high-quality Majorana modes, despite the modest chain size.",

    "abstract": "While international efforts have characterized genetic variation in millions of individuals, the interplay of environmental, social, cultural and genetic factors is poorly understood for most worldwide populations. The province of Quebec in Canada has been the site of numerous genetic studies, often focusing on Mendelian diseases in founder sub-populations. Here, we analyze genome-wide genotyped variation in 29,337 Quebec residents from the multi-ancestry population-based cohort CARTaGENE (CaG) who provided DNA samples. We also sequence the whole-genome of 2,173 CaG participants with four grandparents born in Canada (n\u2009=\u20091879), Haiti (n\u2009=\u2009163) and Morocco (n\u2009=\u2009131). We use this genetic information to gain insight into Quebec's demography and to help interpret the potential significance of variants identified in clinically important genes (e.g., SPG7 implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia). We validate an imputation panel constructed by phasing the CaG whole-genome sequence data and find, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 42 clinically relevant traits, that it increases the number of associated loci by ~7% when compared to results obtained after imputation with the larger TOPMed imputation panel. We provide allele frequency information and GWAS results through dedicated and publicly available websites. The genetic data, paired with phenotypic and environmental information, is available for global research use.",

    "abstract": "Microglial phagocytosis exerts essential roles in neurodegeneration, but how phagocytic processes may reciprocally regulate microglia remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that microglial response in the mouse model of pathological axonal degeneration depends on the phagocytic receptor MerTK. The MerTK-triggered downstream phospholipase C signal is sufficient to induce the up-regulation of PU.1 and IRF8, the two central transcription factors governing microglial functions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses identify that PU.1 and IRF8 directly target the gene locus of TGF\u03b21, and disruption of this PU.1-IRF8 targeting site abolishes the induction of microglial TGF\u03b21 during neurodegeneration. Of importance, neurodegeneration-induced TGF\u03b21 acts in an autocrine manner, and the microglia-specific deletion of TGF\u03b21 or its receptors TGF\u03b2R1 or TGF\u03b2R2 blocks microglial response. Moreover, microglial TGF\u03b21 autocrine signaling similarly occurs in the 5\u00d7FAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in human patients. These results have delineated an important mechanism underlying microglial response to neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Few adult patients with cancer enroll in oncology clinical trials. A rate-limiting step to trial enrollment is prescreening, involving clinical research staff manually abstracting unstructured health records to identify patients who meet eligibility criteria. Prescreening is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, resulting in under-identification of eligible patients. Neurosymbolic AI language models may approximate or improve the accuracy of prescreening through automated abstraction of enrollment criteria from longitudinal unstructured patient charts. We conduct a randomized noninferiority trial using retrospectively collected clinical charts to compare the accuracy and efficiency of prescreening by trained research staff alone (Human-alone) vs. augmented with a pre-trained language model (Human+AI), among a cohort of 355 patients with non-small cell lung or colorectal cancer. Sample size is determined from analyses of a preliminary dataset as well as a prespecified, interim dataset of 74 charts. Chart-level accuracy, the primary endpoint of Human+AI prescreening is noninferior and superior to Human-alone (76.5% vs. 71.1%). However, efficiency is unchanged with similar average time per chart review, the secondary endpoint, (37.4 vs. 37.8\u2009min). AI-assisted abstraction most improves accuracy for biomarker, staging, and response criteria. Performance is limited in some domains due to automation bias. Although improvements are modest, this large randomized trial evaluating a human-AI framework for oncology prescreening shows that AI language models can approximate and augment human-driven prescreening to enhance identification of trial-eligible patients, potentially increasing enrollment. The trial is registered on ClinicialTrials.gov (NCT06561217).",

    "abstract": "Protein C-termini can vary due to errors or programmed regulation, contributing to proteome diversity, yet their impact on the proteome remains poorly understood. Although aberrant C-termini are often linked to protein degradation, it is unclear if this holds true universally. In this study, we examine how C-terminal variations-arising from disease-associated nonstop mutations, alternative splicing, and translational readthrough-affect protein half-lives. Our findings indicate that, contrary to previous studies, erroneous C-termini can either stabilize or destabilize proteins. We have identified multiple oncoproteins and tumor suppressors whose protein stability is altered by disease-relevant nonstop mutations. Notably, we have found that C-terminal variations commonly influence the stability of canonical proteins, extending beyond their role in protein quality control. Furthermore, we have uncovered C-terminal features that distinguish erroneous from wild-type proteins and reveal that hydrophobic C-termini are targeted by a complex ubiquitin ligase network. Overall, our work broadens the understanding of C-terminal-dependent protein degradation and supports that C-terminal variation is a widespread strategy for generating protein forms with distinct half-lives to exert diverse biological functions.",

Here, we conduct life cycle assessment to compare both technologies quantitatively and identify environmental savings in 15 of 16 environmental impact categories for tunnel oxide passivated contact. This includes a 6.5% reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, per watt peak at the expense of 15.2% increase in metal resource use, for photovoltaic modules manufactured in China and transported to central Europe. A critical factor in photovoltaics manufacturing is the carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We model the impact of photovoltaics production across different global regions, incorporating future electricity mix scenarios and a projection for photovoltaics deployment. Our model provides a forecast of the environmental impact of global photovoltaics manufacturing and identifies a potential reduction of 8.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2035, depending on manufacturing location.",

Here, we show that Escherichia coli (E. coli) is prevalent in CRC tissues with LM using 2bRAD-M-Seq and is linked to the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Utilizing multi-omics and molecular techniques, we establish that E. coli recruits RIPK2, which promotes the binding of HNRNPK to the Atf3/Relb promoters in neutrophils, thereby enhancing their transcription. This process results in the upregulation of Ncf4, which triggers p-MLKL-mediated NET formation. NETs, in turn, increase the expression of TRPC1 and NFATC3 in CRC cells, promoting the calcium-dependent assembly of the STAT3/S100A8/9 heterotrimer. This trimer stabilizes STAT3-enhancer-promoter loops (EPLs), thereby reinforcing the Tns1 transcription and facilitating CRCLM. Our findings elucidate the mechanism by which E. coli-induced NETs promote CRCLM through epigenetic modifications, offering an insight into the role of EPLs in immune regulation and tumor progression.",

Using this co-packaged module, we demonstrate carbon monoxide detection via second-harmonic measurements, outlining a clear route towards fully integrated on-chip implementations. This compact, hybrid, multi-functional architecture markedly reduces system complexity and footprint compared with conventional benchtop systems and is intrinsically compatible with the rapidly developing lithium niobate integrated photonics ecosystem.

We demonstrate that, upon infection, an increase in intracellular calcium triggers tight junction destabilization, by activating the calmodulin and myosin light chain kinase signalization. We identify two bacterial effectors of the Virulence-Modifying (VM) proteins family, structurally related to toxin-like proteins, that promote modulation of calcium homeostasis and disruption of cell-cell junctions, thereby allowing Leptospira translocation across epithelium barriers, tissue colonization and pathogenicity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that at least one of these VM proteins is secreted and associates with host cells. Altogether, these findings reveal a unique strategy by which an extracellular pathogen secretes toxin-like proteins to exploit host calcium signaling for breaching epithelial barriers.",

To address this, we developed a microphysiological system (MPS) featuring multicellular human hepatic spheroids physically integrated with self-organized microvascular networks. We demonstrate this MPS's utility by modeling an insulin resistance state, where chronic exposure to disease-mimetic conditions yields altered hepatocyte metabolism, dysregulated vascular features, and increased inflammation state. We extend this system to capture disease-relevant changes in immune cell recruitment, showing that monocytes perfused through the vasculature will extravasate toward hepatic spheroids, with insulin-resistant samples exhibiting greater infiltration. Altogether, this vascularized liver MPS captures local hepatocyte-immune-microvascular interactions in an accessible microfluidic platform, enabling the study of clinically relevant immune-tissue interactions in complex metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "When the species composition of ecological communities changes over time, environmental drivers are often invoked as the most plausible explanation. Several lines of reasoning, however, suggest that such compositional change, called temporal species turnover, can similarly result from intrinsic ecosystem dynamics, even in a constant environment. The degree to which these two drivers contribute to observed turnover remains unclear. To address this conundrum, we analyse the well-established BioTIME database of surveys. We expect either an acceleration of turnover with accelerating climate change or constant turnover if intrinsic mechanisms dominate. Surprisingly we find instead that species turnover over short time intervals (1-5 years) has decelerated in significantly more communities during the last 100 years than it has accelerated, typically by one third. The observed slowing of turnover, we argue, could be understood-when intrinsic dynamics dominate-as resulting because anthropogenic environmental degradation or declines of regional species pools reduce the number of potential colonisers driving turnover. Our results suggest that observed past changes in species composition were often manifestations of natural, intrinsic ecosystem dynamics. Although one can expect environmental drivers to dominate species turnover eventually as climate change accelerates further, for now such attribution should be done with caution.",

Pyroclastic deposits, although volumetrically minor compared to mare basalts, are derived from deeper, more primitive, and volatile-rich mantle sources. Here we synthesize volatile degassing recorded by Apollo 17 sample 74220, one of most studied pyroclastic deposits. By modeling the volatile degassing of olivine-hosted melt inclusions, melt embayments, and glass beads, we show that volatile depletion of these samples cannot be explained solely by degassing during free-flight, as previously proposed. Instead, the data require extended thermal histories, with beads undergoing slow cooling and prolonged degassing on the lunar surface for years, a scenario further supported by thermal modeling. Our findings suggest that pyroclastic deposits remained active volatile sources well beyond eruption, which is potentially important for sustaining a local transient lunar atmosphere and the long-term volatile cycle of the Moon.",

Gut microbiota transfer from capsaicin-treated mice produced similar effects of capsaicin intake.

    "title": "Intradermal delivery of lipophilic siRNAs enables prolonged skin retention and sustained gene silencing in a porcine model.",
    "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) offer significant therapeutic potential; however, extrahepatic applications, particularly to the skin, remain a challenge. Limited work has explored siRNA therapies for the skin, the largest organ in the human body, where dermatological conditions affect over one-third of the population worldwide. The skin's external location makes it easily accessible for direct, local administration. Here, we present the in vivo intradermal delivery of therapeutic siRNAs into a porcine model whose skin structure most closely resembles that of human skin, demonstrating functional, and sustained gene silencing. We characterize two siRNA conjugates in human ex vivo and porcine in vivo skin models, showing that increased hydrophobicity significantly enhances skin retention and efficacy of siRNAs. Using a validated JAK1-targeting compound, we demonstrate that local delivery of siRNA enables accumulation across multiple cell types and suppression of JAK1-dependent inflammatory pathway in human skin ex vivo. In porcine models, intradermal injections result in prolonged skin siRNA retention for more than eight weeks, limited systemic tissue exposure, and sustained gene silencing for at least one month. These results underscore the importance of tailored siRNA conjugate design for achieving optimal skin biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy, providing a foundation for siRNA-based treatments for a broad range of dermatological conditions.",

    "abstract": "The low quantitative accuracy of conventional small noncoding RNA sequencing (sncRNA-seq) methods due to extensive ligation bias commonly limits functional investigation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Here, we develop 4NBoost, a single-tube sncRNA-seq protocol designed to minimize bias in the estimated absolute quantification of miRNA and piRNA transcripts through the incorporation of quantitative exogenous RNA spike-ins. With 4NBoost, we profile sncRNA expression across 20 murine tissues, 18 macaque tissues, and 24 widely used cell lines, as well as 4 Arabidopsis tissues, to establish a comprehensive quantitative reference atlas. Compared with existing small RNA databases, our data reveal substantial biases in miRNA abundance, strand selection, and tissue-specific expression at both individual and family levels. To further extend its utility, we employ machine learning to model and correct biases in conventional datasets, effectively recovering ground truth transcript abundances. All 4NBoost data and the accompanying bias-correction model are freely available via SmRNAQuant (http://wulg-lab.sibcb.ac.cn/SmRNAQuant/), a web-based repository for exploring sncRNA expression. Together, the 4NBoost, bias-correction model, and SmRNAQuant provide powerful resources to advance sncRNA research.",

    "abstract": "Detecting and utilizing salience information are essential for organisms to prioritize behaviorally relevant stimuli. While the prefrontal cortex is critical for cognition and learning, how it leverages salience information remains unclear. We report that chandelier cells (ChCs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a unique GABAergic interneuron, encode salience information and influence learning. Using cell-type-specific calcium signal recording in male mice, we demonstrate that ChCs respond robustly to stimuli across modalities, with responses dependent on stimulus salience, as determined by novelty and intensity. Circuit-specific manipulations reveal that ChC salience coding is attributable to synaptic inputs from the anterior insular cortex and paraventricular thalamus. Furthermore, ChCs acquire salience-coding property for behaviorally relevant stimuli through associative learning. Notably, bidirectional manipulations of ChC-mediated salience detection correspondingly led to improved or impaired associative learning. Together, these findings establish mPFC ChCs as a key circuit element for processing salience information to shape learning and behavior.",

Here, we report on a human 'mini-bladder' model that exposes a stratified urothelium to urine of defined composition, and incorporates micturition. Prolonged exposure to high-solute concentration urine weakens tight junctions, dysregulates immune responses, and reduces bladder tissue resilience. This increases susceptibility to colonisation of the bladder by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) which reduces efficacy of antibiotic therapy. In high-solute concentration urine, Fosfomycin monotherapy - prescribed for uncomplicated UTIs, induces the formation of cell wall-deficient (CWD) UPEC in the urine (as observed in patients with recurrent UTIs) but also within deeper urothelial layers. Tissue-associated CWD UPEC directly contributes to recurrence. Our findings expand the conceptual role for CWD UPEC in UTIs, and demonstrate the power of the mini-bladder platform to capture urine-urothelial microenvironment dynamics that actively shape UTI pathogenesis and antibiotic tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for all living organisms. PstSCAB, a bacterial high-affinity ABC transporter, imports Pi under limiting conditions via five subunits: PstA and PstC forming the transmembrane domain (TMD), periplasmic PstS that switches between free and TMD-docked forms for Pi capture and delivery, and two cytosolic PstB subunits for ATP binding and hydrolysis. Its malfunction affects the virulence of pathogenic bacteria, making it pharmaceutically attractive. However, complete structural pictures of PstSCAB in different states remain lacking. Here, we determine cryo-EM structures of PstSCAB in resting, pretranslocation, and catalytic intermediate states, which reveal that conformational changes in PstS and ATP binding/unbinding in PstB collectively induce rigid-body movements\u00a0of\u00a0TMD, generating inward- or outward-facing conformations. In TMD,\u00a0Pi specificity is determined by positively charged Arg220 (PstA) and Arg237 (PstC).

Tissue neighborhoods are generated to allow geometric profiling of spatial densities and interactions at a range of scales. Multivariate modelling of ICI response yields a model that predicts progression-free survival (PFS) over 24 months (AUC\u2009=\u20090.8).

Systematic characterization and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that M-CDs, which are structurally analogous to the MPD monomer, promote monomer diffusion, regulate cross-linking density, and refine the microstructure of the PA layer. At an optimal M-CDs concentration, the resulting membrane achieves simultaneous enhancements in both salt rejection (99.1% vs. 96.5%) and water flux (18.3 vs. 15.2\u2009L\u00b7m",

However, these features are highly susceptible to interference from illumination, eyelid/eyelash occlusion, and individual variations, leading to low recognition rates and diminished tracking accuracy. To address these limitations, eye movement feature enhanced cosmetic contact lenses are proposed, implementing a spatial-chromatic encoding strategy. Employing a head-mounted eye tracker integrated with RGB cameras, this system enables accurate and robust gaze tracking in natural environments. Under challenging illumination, the lenses achieve a 93% feature recognition rate, significantly surpassing pupil recognition and tolerating highly off-axis camera placement. Eye movement model and human eye tracking demonstrate superior accuracy (<1\u00b0), gaze direction estimation, and continuous fixation positioning. Utilizing these lenses, diverse eye-tracking applications are demonstrated, including image identification, reading analysis, and outdoor interaction. This approach advances the development of lightweight, unobtrusive eye-tracking systems and facilitates broader application of gaze-based interaction technology in real-world settings.",

To address this limitation, we develop Raichu, a normalization method for chromatin contact data. Raichu identifies nearly twice as many loops as conventional normalization approaches, recovering almost all previously detected loops while uncovering thousands of additional enhancer-promoter interactions that are otherwise missed. With its improved sensitivity for regulatory loops, Raichu detects more biologically meaningful differential interactions, including those between conditions within the same cell type. Moreover, Raichu performs robustly across a wide range of sequencing depths, resolutions, species, and experimental platforms, making it a versatile tool for revealing insights into three-dimensional genome organization and transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "The liver contains both diploid and polyploid hepatocytes, but their functional differences remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that each ploidy state contributes to regeneration in an injury-specific manner. We hypothesized that diploid hepatocytes promote healing after acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. To study ploidy populations in vivo, we utilized mice with a lifelong liver-specific knockout of E2f7/E2f8 (LKO), which are enriched in diploid hepatocytes (>\u200970%) but otherwise normal. Control and LKO mice were treated with APAP (300 or 600\u2009mg/kg), and injury was assessed over 0-96\u2009h. Although both groups sustained injury, LKO mice showed improved survival, lower serum liver enzyme levels, and reduced necrosis and DNA fragmentation, indicating resistance to APAP-induced injury. To determine if resistance was due to E2f7/E2f8 loss or increased diploidy, we deleted E2f7/E2f8 in adult hepatocytes (HKO), a model that does not alter ploidy. Injury was similar between controls and HKO, ruling out gene deletion as the protective factor. Transcriptomic and protein analyses revealed minimal baseline differences; however, following APAP treatment, LKO livers exhibited reduced JNK activation and less mitochondrial injury. Finally, APAP-treated wild-type hepatocytes exhibited a shift toward lower ploidy, supporting the idea that diploid cells are more resistant to injury. These findings highlight hepatocyte ploidy as a key determinant of injury response and suggest a protective role for diploid hepatocytes in promoting liver resilience and regeneration.",

To address this limitation, we develop a metabolic glycoengineering-click chemistry strategy that enables in situ incorporation of azide groups into bacterial cellulose, followed by mild and selective conjugation of alkyne-bearing functional molecules. This approach avoids harsh chemical treatments, preserves the native properties of bacterial cellulose, and supports stable attachment of diverse bioactive agents, including antibacterial porphyrins, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptides, and recombinant proteins with fluorescent or enzymatic functions. As a proof-of-concept, a cascade catalytic system comprising glucose oxidase and superoxide dismutase is immobilized onto azide-modified bacterial cellulose, yielding a multifunctional wound dressing designed to address hyperglycemia and oxidative stress-key barriers to chronic wound healing. In male diabetic mice, this glucose oxidase/superoxide dismutase-integrated bacterial cellulose dressing (low endotoxin <0.1 EU/mL) accelerates wound closure to 92.1% by day 14, significantly outperforming the controls. Our strategy highlights a scalable and bio-orthogonal route for enhancing bacterial cellulose with user-defined bioactivities, thereby expanding its utility in advanced biomaterials development.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate that defects in RPA loading caused by LAP2\u03b1 deficiency slow breast tumor growth and sensitize tumors to chemotherapeutic treatments. In addition, we found that LAP2\u03b1 could directly stimulate the loading of RPA onto ssDNA. Collectively, our study characterizes a critical role of LAP2\u03b1-enhanced RPA loading in promoting breast tumorigenesis and positions the LAP2\u03b1-RPA complex as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer.",

    "title": "Single-cell exon deletion profiling reveals splicing events that shape gene expression and cell state dynamics.",
    "abstract": "Alternative splicing is a pervasive gene regulatory mechanism critical for diversifying the human proteome. To systematically investigate its role in cell fate determination, we develop scCHyMErA-Seq, a scalable CRISPR-based exon deletion screening platform integrated with 10x Genomics single-cell transcriptomic readouts. This tool enables efficient exon deletion while simultaneously capturing Cas9/Cas12a guides and polyadenylated transcripts at single-cell resolution. Applying scCHyMErA-Seq to high-throughput profiling of alternative cassette exons, we identify numerous exons with pronounced regulatory effects on gene expression and cell cycle progression. Analysis of the alternative NRF1 exon-7 demonstrates that its inclusion modulates NRF1's regulatory function by influencing its recruitment to the promoters of target genes. Importantly, gene expression profiles generated using scCHyMErA-Seq accurately recapitulate findings from traditional, labor-intensive orthogonal methods, while offering enhanced scalability and efficiency. Overall, scCHyMErA-Seq represents a versatile platform for systematically unraveling the functional impact of alternative splicing by directly linking specific splicing variants to transcriptional phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Human cognitive processing involves dynamic interactions across brain regions, evolving over time. Traditional neuroimaging analysis often overlooks this temporal aspect, limiting insights into how functional network connectivity (FNC) supports ongoing cognition and behaviour. Using sliding window analysis, we captured FNC changes during tasks, reflecting network reconfiguration in cognitive processes. We further determined behavioural relevance of time-varying FNC by relating network measurements with task performances and psychopathology. We found that several whole-brain FNC patterns, or states, persist across resting and task-based fMRI, with state occurrences fluctuating with the most prominent task stimuli. Regional FNC distinguishes specific task conditions, and time-varying FNC explains more variance in psychopathology symptoms compared to static connectivity. These findings highlight that cognitive tasks reshape regional and whole-brain connectivity. By considering the different FNC states, time-varying connectivity provides a more comprehensive representation of brain interactions and thus may represent a better neural proxy for cognition and behaviour.",

    "title": "Human prestige psychology can promote adaptive inequality in social influence.",
    "abstract": "Human hunter-gatherer groups were commonly thought to be broadly egalitarian, with increasingly formal hierarchical social structures hypothesized to spread following the introduction of agriculture. However, this view is being challenged by mounting evidence for social hierarchies in several foraging populations. Nonetheless, the processes by which such hierarchies emerge, and whether human hierarchies are homologous with non-human systems of dominance, remains unclear. Here we examine the role of prestige, the tendency to freely confer status and influence on skilled or esteemed individuals and a proposed component of human-unique cultural psychology, in generating unequal patterns of social influence. Through a combination of cultural evolutionary modelling, human experimentation, and evolutionary simulations, we find that human prestige psychology generates highly unequal influence hierarchies, and that the \"prestige sensitivity\" we measure empirically in human participants closely matches the predictions of our evolutionary simulations, suggesting it is an evolved psychological adaptation. Nonetheless, unlike non-human dominance hierarchies, the processes involved are non-coercive, being driven by individuals freely seeking high quality information. We thus conclude that social hierarchies plausibly have a deep evolutionary history in our lineage, with prestige\u00a0enabling hierarchies to be mutually beneficial as opposed to coercive.",

Northwest Irish and Outer Hebrideans are at the highest risk (1/54 - 1/62 carry the major risk genotype), Mainland Scots are also at increased risk (1/117), declining to 1/212 in Southern England. We also assessed the prevalence of clinically diagnosed haemochromatosis in >63 million people in NHS England and identified 70,365 cases. White Irish individuals have the highest prevalence (3.7x white British). Among white British, prevalence varied 11-fold from 1/1972 in parts of Kent to 1/177 in Liverpool. Discrepancies between genetic risks and prevalences of clinical diagnoses for Birmingham, Cumbria, Northumberland and Durham suggest under-diagnosis in these regions. We show heightened genetic risk of haemochromatosis in people of Northwest Irish and Hebridean ancestry and suggest health-economic modelling of community screening should be targeted to these priority areas.",

    "abstract": "Recurrence and metastasis are the main causes of death in ovarian cancer (OC). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered as good prognostic models and potential therapeutic targets for cancer patients because of their easy detection and strong correlation. Our study identifies an OC-associated lncRNA with tumor progression and therapeutic implications. It's found that lncRNA AC093895.1 is highly expressed in OC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. AC093895.1 has a potentiating effect during the progression and metastasis of ovarian cancer. The effects of AC093895.1 on ovarian cancer cells are miR-1253 dependent. Results showed that by interacting with tumor-suppressive gene miR-1253 as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNAs), AC093895.1 significantly upregulated the downstream gene SOX4 of AC093895.1/ miR-1253 axis, leading to tumor metastasis. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) results further confirmed that SOX4 could bind to the AC093895.1 promoter, forming a positive feedback loop SOX4/AC093895.1/miR-1253/SOX4. Therapeutic strategy to break the loop through AC093895.1 knockdown exhibited attenuated OC growth and metastasis in vivo both in SK-OV-3 subcutaneous model and pulmonary metastatic model. Our study unveiled the potentiating effects of SOX4/AC093895.1/miR-1253/SOX4 on ovarian cancer cell survival, migration, and invasion. AC093895.1 may be a promising patient prognostic biomarker and therapeutic candidate.Created with BioRender.com.",

    "abstract": "The dopaminergic system has key roles in human physiology and is implicated in a broad range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions that are increasingly investigated using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain models. To determine similarities of such models to human systems, here we undertake single-cell and spatial profiling of first and second trimester fetal midbrain and compare it to in vitro midbrain models. Histological examination reveals that, by the second trimester, fetal midbrain tissue exhibits structural complexity comparable to that of adults. At the molecular level, single-cell profiling uncovers differences in cellular composition across models, with brain organoids most closely resembling late first trimester tissue - an observation supported by meta-integration of existing midbrain datasets. By reconstructing developmental trajectories of neuronal and astrocytic lineages, we map gene expression dynamics associated with maturation. Importantly, integration of spatial transcriptomics provides critical context for aligning organoid models, revealing that their spatial organization and intercellular signaling resemble the architecture and microenvironment of the second trimester midbrain. Ultimately, we leverage our findings to study Dopamine Transporter Deficiency Syndrome progression in patient-derived midbrain organoids, validating their relevance. Understanding the extent of human tissue recapitulation in midbrain laboratory models is essential to justify their use as biological proxies.",

Perturbation of microexons during neurogenesis reveals convergent roles in the temporal regulation of gene expression programs that direct signaling pathways and morphogenesis. We further observe microexons, including those in the Bin1, Clasp1, Gfra1, Med23, Ptprf and Ralgapb genes, that are required for the correct timing of autism-linked gene expression.

Computational methods for inferring missing links can facilitate field work and investigations of ecological processes. Here, we describe a stacked generalization approach to predict missing links in food webs that accounts for ecological assumptions including link direction. Tests of this method on synthetic food webs show that it can learn to optimally combine structural and trait-based predictions. On a global database of 290 food webs, the method often achieves near-perfect performance, performs better when it can exploit both species traits and network structure, and is principally driven by a subset of ecologically-interpretable predictors. Furthermore, we find that link predictability varies with ecosystem and network characteristics. These results show broad applicability of stacked generalization for predicting and understanding ecological interactions.",

An exception was the transcription of type I interferon (IFN-I)-stimulated genes (ISGs), which were selectively induced by HLA-G through a noncanonical pathway. This ISG response required the transcription factor IRF7 and the kinase JAK1. The carboxyl-terminal portion of the KIR2DL4 cytoplasmic tail includes a sequence analogous to conserved JAK1 binding sites in IFN receptors and was required for JAK1 binding to KIR2DL4. Phosphorylation of IRF7 and the JAK substrate STAT2, which link IFN-I stimulation to ISG transcription, was detected in the nuclei of HLA-G-stimulated NK cells.

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that is characterized by dysregulated cytokine signaling. Treatment outcomes for patients with UC remain suboptimal despite the advent of cytokine-targeting therapies, necessitating a better understanding of the interconnected cytokine signaling networks that are perturbed in patients with UC. To address this, we undertook systems immunology modeling of single-cell transcriptomics data from colonic biopsies of treatment-naive and treatment-exposed patients with UC to build complex cytokine signaling networks underpinned by putative cytokine-cytokine interactions. The generated cytokine networks effectively captured known, physiologically relevant cytokine-cytokine interactions, which we validated in vitro in colonic epithelial organoids derived from patients with UC and with organoids cocultured with innate lymphoid cells. These networks revealed several previously unrecognized aspects of UC pathogenesis. These included the identification of a cytokine subnetwork that is unique to treatment-naive patients with UC, of cytokines with altered interaction patterns across UC disease states (including IL-22, TL1A, IL-23A, and OSM), and of cytokine-cytokine interactions that were mediated by specific members of the Janus-associated kinase (JAK) family. In particular, our network analysis positioned TL1A as an important upstream regulator of TNF and IL-23A (both of which are targeted by approved UC drugs) and suggested it as a potential therapeutic target. Together, these findings open several avenues for guiding future cytokine-targeting therapeutic approaches in UC, and the presented methodology can be readily applied to gain similar insights into other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Immune responses in tissues display complex spatial patterns of gene expression that are linked to disease outcomes. However, the processes that generate these patterns-including the relative roles of noisy gene expression dynamics, microbial transport, and tissue anatomy-are poorly understood. As a tractable model of spatial immune responses, we investigated heterogeneous expression of antimicrobial peptides in the larval fly fat body, an organ functionally analogous to the liver. To quantify single-cell antimicrobial peptide expression dynamics in the fat body, we developed a protocol for light sheet fluorescence microscopy of whole, live larvae. Using this approach, we discovered that individual fat body cells express antimicrobial peptides at approximately constant rates following infection, but that the average rate varies along the anterior-posterior axis of the fat body, with rapid expression in the anterior and posterior lobes. Overexpression of immune signaling components and analysis of spatial transcriptomes revealed that these tissue microenvironments are predefined independently of infection, with the rate-limiting step of antimicrobial peptide induction downstream of peptidoglycan sensing. The locations of these microevironments correlate with heartbeat-dependent fluid flow in a manner resembling the strategic positioning of immune cells in the liver, gut, and lymph nodes of mammals. We speculate that this spatial compartmentalization helps the fat body efficiently perform its diverse metabolic, enzymatic, and immunological functions.",

    "abstract": "Retinal detachment (RD) is a sight-threatening emergency requiring urgent intervention to prevent permanent vision loss. While both environmental and genetic risk factors contribute to RD, its complete genetic architecture remains unknown. Here, we performed the largest whole genome sequencing-based case-control study in RD to date, including data from 7,276 RD cases and 236,741 controls in the UK Biobank. Through variant- and gene-level association analyses, we identified VSX2 as a genetic determinant of RD risk while confirming established associations including FAT3, RDH5, and COL2A1. Gene-level collapsing analysis revealed that rare heterozygous missense variants in VSX2 confer a 2.8-fold increased risk of RD (p\u2009=\u20092.4x10-10; odds ratio (OR) = 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.1, 3.7]). One missense variant in this gene, p.Glu218Asp, demonstrated a particularly strong effect size (p\u2009=\u20099.3x10-10; OR = 5.9; 95% CI: [3.7, 9.4]). Replication analyses in two additional cohorts, totaling 1,331 cases and 52,355 controls strengthened both the gene- and variant-level associations even further (p\u2009=\u20091.4x10-10 and 1.1x10-11, respectively). Other contributory heterozygous variants included previously reported pathogenic homozygous variants for anophthalmia and microphthalmia. These findings thus reveal a previously unknown gene dosage curve for VSX2, where homozygous mutations cause severe developmental eye disorders and heterozygous mutations cause adult-onset retinal detachment. Extending this observation, we found a significant enrichment for other known recessive Mendelian eye disease genes among nominally significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) genes associated with RD in the collapsing analysis. This work provides a compelling example of how heterozygous variants in recessive disease genes can be associated with less severe clinical phenotypes.",

Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort. The insights gleaned from this study shed light on potential pathways for BV prevention and treatment.",

    "title": "Automatic learning mechanisms for flexible human locomotion.",
    "abstract": "Movement flexibility and automaticity are necessary to successfully navigate different environments. When encountering difficult terrains such as a muddy trail, we can change how we step almost immediately so that we can continue walking. This flexibility comes at a cost since we initially must pay deliberate attention to how we are moving. Gradually, after a few minutes on the trail, stepping becomes automatic so that we do not need to think about our movements. Canonical theory indicates that different adaptive motor learning mechanisms confer these essential properties to movement: explicit control confers rapid flexibility, while forward model recalibration confers automaticity. Here, we uncover a distinct mechanism of treadmill walking adaptation - an automatic stimulus-response mapping - that confers both properties to movement. The mechanism is flexible as it learns stepping patterns that can be rapidly changed to suit a range of treadmill configurations. It is also automatic as it can operate without deliberate control or explicit awareness by the participants. Our findings reveal a tandem architecture of forward model recalibration and automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for walking, reconciling different findings of motor adaptation and perceptual realignment.",

The biogenesis of \u03b1-granules is incompletely understood but depends on common endosomal pathways. Here, we discovered GRIPAP1, a partially characterized ubiquitous protein, as a new component of the \u03b1-granule biogenesis machinery. GRIPAP1-deficient megakaryocytes showed a significant decrease of \u03b1-granule numbers and overall cargo levels. In WT megakaryocytes, fibrinogen taken up by endocytosis and newly synthesized PF4 trafficked through GRIPAP1-labeled compartments en route to \u03b1-granules. GRIPAP1 localized to endosome subdomains decorated by Rab4a and Stx12, known players in \u03b1-granule biogenesis. GRIPAP1 bound GTP-loaded Rab4a, a key interaction for GRIPAP1 recruitment to membranes. Biochemically, GRIPAP1 behaved as an elongated homodimer akin to membrane tethering factors. Consistently, artificial mislocalization of GRIPAP1 to the mitochondria was sufficient to recruit Rab4a compartments containing internalized transferring and newly synthesized PF4 to mitochondria. Together, the data advance understanding of endosomal transport, the biogenesis of \u03b1-granules, and likely other endo-lysosomal organelles.",

    "abstract": "Micronuclei (MN), a hallmark of chromosome instability, frequently rupture, leading to protumorigenic consequences. MN rupture requires nuclear lamina defects, yet their underlying causes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that MN lamina gaps are linked to excessive MN growth resulting from impaired protein export. This export defect arises from reduced levels of the transport protein RCC1 in MN. Overexpressing RCC1 increases protein export and protects MN from rupture. Differences in RCC1 levels linked to chromatin state also explain why high euchromatin content increases the stability of small MN. Additional RCC1 loss in euchromatic MN results in impaired protein import. For these MN, increasing RCC1, directly or through increasing histone methylation, accelerates rupture. Our findings define a new model of MN rupture, where defects in protein export drives continuous MN growth causing nuclear lamina gaps that predispose MN to membrane rupture and where chromatin-specific features can alter rupture of small MN by further impairing nuclear transport.",

To broaden its clinical applicability and identify more effective combination strategies, we conducted a drug screen combining PARP inhibitors with 74 well-characterized epigenetic modulators targeting five major classes of epigenetic enzymes. Notably, both type I PRMT inhibitors and PRMT5 inhibitors scored highly in combination efficacy and clinical prioritization. PRMT inhibition significantly enhanced PARP inhibitor-induced DNA damage in human HR-proficient ovarian and breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, PRMT suppression downregulates DNA damage repair genes and BRCAness-associated pathways, while also modulating intrinsic innate immune responses within cancer cells. Integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and functional datasets from TCGA and DepMap further supports PRMT1, PRMT4, and PRMT5 as promising therapeutic targets in oncology. Importantly, dual inhibition of PRMT1 and PRMT5 synergistically sensitizes tumors to PARP inhibitors. Collectively, our findings provide strong rationale for the clinical development of PRMT and PARP inhibitor combinations in HR-proficient ovarian and breast cancers.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin organisation and transcriptional regulation are tightly coordinated processes that are essential for maintaining cellular identity and function. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins play critical roles in control of genome structure and in regulating transcription across eukaryotes. Their essential nature, however, has made it difficult to define exactly how these functions are mediated. The chromatin remodeller CHD4 has been shown to be capable of sliding nucleosomes in vitro, and to regulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression in vivo. Using an inducible depletion system, here we identify a second mechanism of action for CHD4 in actively restricting the residence time of transcription factors (TFs) on chromatin. Together, these activities result in distinct, context-dependent outcomes: at highly accessible regulatory elements, CHD4 limits TF binding to maintain regulatory function, while at low-accessibility euchromatic regions, it prevents TF engagement and sustains chromatin compaction, thereby silencing cryptic enhancers. Collectively, these mechanisms enable CHD4 to reduce transcriptional noise while preserving the responsiveness of active regulatory networks.",

Eligible patients were refractory upon prior endocrine therapy. Prior treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors and everolimus was allowed. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either taselisib (4mg) + tamoxifen (20mg) or placebo + tamoxifen. The primary endpoint of the trial was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (two-sided alpha 0.2, 90% power). Exploratory biomarker analysis with regards to prognosis and treatment resistance were conducted in circulating tumor (ct)DNA.\nPOSEIDON met its primary endpoint, where patients treated with taselisib + tamoxifen had improved PFS compared to patients treated with placebo + tamoxifen in the ITT population (median PFS 4.8 months versus. 3.2 months; stratified hazard ratio 0.69, 80% CI 0.49-0.98, p=0.17). However, toxicity of taselisib was significant with diarrhea (40% any grade) as most common adverse event. Exploratory analyses indicated that high tumor fraction determined in ctDNA at baseline is associated with worse PFS and OS (p<0.0001).\nOur findings suggest efficacy of PI3K inhibition + tamoxifen beyond second-line treatment and after prior targeted therapies, including CDK4/6 inhibition in metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer although the magnitude of benefit did not outweigh the tolerability of this combination.

Adjuvant treatment decisions and post-surgical plasma sample collection timepoints were at the physician's discretion. ctDNA results were correlated with clinical outcomes.\nAcross 190 patients and a total of 1,578 samples, a median of 7 ctDNA tests (range: 1-33) per patient were performed over a median period of 24.6 months (range: 3.7 - 74.7). ctDNA-positivity at any postoperative timepoint was significantly associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS; hazard ratio [HR]: 40.63, 95% CI: 19.9 - 82.96, P<0.0001). This finding was also observed in patients specifically with regional or distant recurrence (HR: 39.55, 95% CI: 18.08 - 86.51, P<0.0001).

Lirafugratinib and futibatinib are irreversible FGFR inhibitors with the most promising clinical activity against FGFR2-driven tumors.\nWe characterized resistance to lirafugratinib with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), tissue whole exome sequencing and bulk-RNA sequencing in 30 patients with FGFR2-driven cancers, treated in the phase 1/2 ReFocus trial (NCT04526106) and enrolled in the UNLOCK program at Gustave Roussy.\nAmong the 30 patients included, 18 (60%) had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and 12 (40%) had other tumor types. Twenty-two patients (73%) were FGFR inhibitor-na\u00efve. Among those experiencing primary resistance to lirafugratinib, we identified potential resistance mechanisms in 5 of 6 pre-treatment samples. Patients with acquired lirafugratinib resistance manifested an unprecedented emergence of FGFR2 mutations in the M538 and/or L618 residues of the kinase domain, documented in 11/16 cases (69%). Compared to futibatinib resistance, FGFR2 molecular brake (N550) and gatekeeper (V565) mutations were rare. Leveraging the spectrum of FGFR2 kinase domain mutations at resistance to lirafugratinib and futibatinib respectively, we identified the complementarity of the two irreversible inhibitors. On the basis of viability assays in FGFR2::BICC1 dependent Ba/F3 models and in vivo studies on patient-derived xenografts, we propose treatment sequences with the two agents. After lirafugratinib progression, three patients received futibatinib and experienced prolonged disease response.\nThe complementary activity of lirafugratinib and futibatinib against FGFR2 kinase domain mutations supports their sequential use, when precise resistance mutations are detected in patients.",

    "abstract": "Segregating a complete set of chromosomes into the gametes relies on exchanges of genetic material that occur during meiosis. It is only exchanges that form between the homologous chromosomes (homologs), rather than between the identical sister chromatids, that enable correct chromosome segregation. Understanding how the homologs and the sisters are distinguished requires knowledge of how they are organized relative to each other. Here, we use selective labeling of a single sister in Caenorhabditis elegans to define the organization of the sister chromatids when meiotic exchanges form. We find that pairs of sisters are well separated (resolved) throughout pachytene, despite being tethered to each other along their length. Depleting the cohesin loader NIPBLSCC-2 impairs sister resolution, suggesting that an active process-likely loop extrusion-demixes the sisters. Our work shows that meiotic exchanges form in C. elegans when the sisters and homolog are roughly the same distance from one another, suggesting that repair template choice is unlikely to rely on relative proximity.",

However, how viruses utilize ER-LD coordination remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection markedly increases LDs abundance and enhances ER-LD contacts. Through a targeted screen of ER-LD tethering proteins, we identified that the NRZ complex, composed of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene (NAG), RAD50 interactor 1 (RINT1) and zeste white 10 (ZW10), is essential for HCV-induced ER-LD association and viral infection. Mechanistically, RINT1 and ZW10 interact with the HCV envelope protein E1. Ectopic E1 expression is sufficient to promote ER-LD contacts, which are abolished upon NRZ depletion. NRZ depletion also impairs Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, suggesting its conserved proviral function. Together, this work uncovers a critical mechanism by which host inter-organelle tethering complexes regulate viral infection, offering new insights into virus-host interactions and potential antiviral targets.",

Melanoma cells must therefore rapidly evade immune detection by modulating cell-autonomous epigenetic mechanisms and tumor-microenvironment interactions. Although angiogenesis typically facilitates immune infiltration, solid tumors increase vascularization while limiting immune cell entry. By comparing transcription factor (TF) expression across early-stage melanoma, naevi, and other cancers, we found that the homeodomain TF HOXD13 drives a melanoblast-like program upregulated in melanoma and strongly correlated with angiogenesis and immune cell exclusion. Using transcriptomics, 3D chromatin profiling, and in vivo models, we show that HOXD13 promotes tumor growth by enhancing angiogenesis and suppressing T-cell infiltration. HOXD13 orchestrates 3D enhancer-promoter contacts activating VEGFA, SEMA3A, and CD73, which remodel vasculature and elevate immunosuppressive adenosine. Consistently, HOXD13-induced tumor growth is reversed by combined VEGFR and adenosine receptor (AdR) inhibition, revealing a dual pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive HOXD13 axis with therapeutic relevance.",

This study examined CC-specific survival by smoking and alcohol status, stratified by immune cell density, in a large population-based cohort. The study included 661 individuals who underwent surgery for stage II or III CC between 2004 and 2008 within two Health and Social Care (HSC) Trusts in Northern Ireland. Representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks were retrieved, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on tissue microarrays constructed from both the central tumour and the invasive margin. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess CC-specific survival, adjusting for key clinical and demographic confounders. Ever smoking, compared to never smoking, was associated with poorer CC-specific survival among individuals with lower densities of CD3+, CD4+ and FOXP3+ tumour-infiltrating immune cells. Among those with higher CD8+ cell density in the central tumour, ever smoking was linked to worse outcomes. Similar patterns were seen in the invasive margin, although these were not all statistically significant. No significant associations were observed between alcohol use and survival across any immune biomarker subgroups. Smoking was associated with poorer survival among patients with CC, and this association appears to be modified by the density of tumour-infiltrating immune cells.",

By screening with this system, we identified that the deletion of cpxR, an E. coli transcription factor for the envelope stress response, delays C. elegans development. This finding led us to investigate how this gene regulates host development.\nWe identified that E. coli \u0394cpxR induced C. elegans developmental delay and activated the C. elegans mitochondrial unfolded protein response pathway through reactive oxygen species. It is widely accepted that the Cpx system is important for bacterial pathogenesis, and activating CpxR is regarded as an antimicrobial strategy. Moreover, we discovered that \u0394cpxR cultured in LB medium, not cultured in M9 minimal medium, delayed C. elegans development, and the L-histidine-related metabolism of \u0394cpxR contributed mostly to the difference. The metabolic fluctuations of commensal bacteria reveal that, rather than the activation of the E. coli Cpx response, the dynamic response of the E. coli Cpx system really contributes to C. elegans development. Furthermore, as the concentration of N-acetylcysteine increased, the phenotype of C. elegans fed \u0394cpxR transitioned from developmental delay to survival resistance. The dynamic response is also indicated in the process in which commensal E. coli improves the stress tolerance of the host C. elegans to N-acetylcysteine.\nOur results illustrate that environmental factors can shape the regulation of the E. coli Cpx response to C. elegans, providing new evidence for why Cpx-mediated virulence phenotypes are inconsistent among gram-negative species in different ecological niches.",

    "title": "Daratumumab in systemic lupus erythematosus: a single-arm phase 2 trial.",
    "abstract": "Antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) play a central role in the pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ASC-depleting anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab in patients with SLE (NCT04810754). The primary endpoint is the reduction in serum anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels at week 12. Key secondary end points include safety, clinical efficacy, and immunologic changes. Ten female patients with active disease and inadequate responses to at least two immunosuppressive drugs have received eight subcutaneous injections of 1800 mg daratumumab weekly, with dexamethasone as premedication (20\u2009mg for first two injections, then 10\u2009mg). By week 12, anti-dsDNA antibody levels have been reduced by a median of 109.6 IU/ml (95% CI 38.1 - 274.5). The treatment resulted in rapid and sustained clinical improvements across all patients and organ domains, reflected by a 100% SRI-4 (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4) response rate at week 12. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 5/10 patients, requiring immunoglobulin substitution. Daratumumab treatment has depleted circulating ASCs, reduced type I interferon activity, and profoundly modulated the T-cell responses. These findings highlight the pivotal role of ASCs in SLE pathogenesis and support daratumumab as therapeutic option for SLE.",

    "title": "Dietary methionine mitigates immune-mediated damage by enhancing renal clearance of cytokines.",
    "abstract": "The immune system defends against pathogens but can also cause tissue damage, energetic costs, and even death through excessive cytokine and chemokine production. Because antimicrobial responses are necessary for host defense, hosts have evolved cooperative defenses to mitigate the costs of immunity. Using Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection in mice, we demonstrate that dietary methionine supplementation protects against cytokine-mediated anorexia, wasting, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and lethality without impairing microbial killing. Methionine and its metabolite S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) activate renal mTORC1 signaling, promoting renal growth and enhanced glomerular filtration function. This enables urinary clearance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the circulation, limiting their systemic accumulation and the resulting sickness and lethality. This work reveals an unappreciated role for the kidneys in controlling systemic cytokine responses during infection. It also suggests that nutrient-based interventions targeting metabolic signaling can mitigate the harmful trade-offs of immune defense, offering potential therapeutic avenues to reduce infection-related costs, including death.",

    "abstract": "While it is well established that the cellular composition of white adipose tissue (WAT) varies between depots, the functional relevance of this heterogeneity remains unclear. By combining spatial and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we provide a comprehensive map of subcutaneous and visceral (omental, mesenteric, mesocolic, and epiploic) WAT in both men and women. Our analyses reveal shared features, such as the spatial organization of adipogenesis, alongside depot-specific characteristics, including distinct cell-type enrichments and unique cell-cell communication routes. Epiploic WAT stands out by harboring high proportions of serum amyloid A expressing fat cells (encoded by SAA1/SAA2) and several leukocyte populations. Through mechanistic studies, we demonstrate that adipocyte SAA1/SAA2 expression is induced by inflammatory signals, including lipopolysaccharide, and that SAA1 activates immune responses in adipose-resident myeloid cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that visceral WAT exhibits distinct cytoarchitectural properties, with those located near the colon adapting by developing specialized adipocytes and immune cell populations.",

    "title": "Mitochondrial transfer from immune to tumor cells enables lymph node metastasis.",
    "abstract": "Although the immune system is a significant barrier to tumor growth and spread, established tumors evade immune attack and frequently colonize immune populated areas such as the lymph node. The mechanisms by which cancer cells subvert the tumor-immune microenvironment to favor spread to the lymph node remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that, as a common attribute, tumor cells hijack mitochondria from a wide array of immune cells. Mitochondria loss by immune cells decreases antigen-presentation and co-stimulatory machinery, as well as reducing the activation and cytotoxic capacity of natural killer (NK) and CD8 T cells. In cancer cells, the exogenous mitochondria fuse with endogenous mitochondria networks, leak mtDNA into the cytosol, and stimulate cGAS/STRING, activating type I interferon-mediated immune evasion programs. Blocking mitochondrial transfer machinery-including cGAS, STRING, or type I interferon-reduced cancer metastasis to the lymph node. These findings suggest that cancer cells leverage mitochondria hijacking to weaken anti-tumor immunosurveillance and use the acquired mitochondria to fuel the immunological requirements of lymph node colonization.",

    "title": "Endometrial stromal cell-derived TMAO sustains decidualization to prevent recurrent spontaneous abortion.",
    "abstract": "Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), often linked to defective endometrial stromal cell (ESC) decidualization, lacks effective metabolism-targeted therapies. Here, we identify the in situ synthesis of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in human decidua as a critical safeguard. Metabolomics revealed significantly lower TMAO levels in decidual tissues of individuals experiencing RSA. Mechanistically, cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) signaling upregulated flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) in ESCs, driving local TMAO accumulation. TMAO directly bound the C terminus of 14-3-3\u03b7, enhancing its interaction with phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) to relieve PDK1-mediated suppression of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). This promoted FOXO1 nuclear translocation and the activation of decidualization markers. Through mouse models employing dietary choline restriction, and FMO3 inhibition via pharmacological or genetic knockout, we demonstrated that endometrial TMAO deficiency impairs decidualization and increases pregnancy loss. Strikingly, TMAO restored decidualization capacity in 15% of patient-derived ESCs with inherent dysfunction. Our findings unveil endometrial TMAO synthesis as a metabolic checkpoint for decidualization and propose it as a therapeutic candidate for RSA.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide is a gasotransmitter with biological functions, including roles in antioxidant defenses, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and cellular signaling via cysteine persulfidation. Several longevity-promoting interventions enhance endogenous hydrogen sulfide generation. However, whether enhanced hydrogen sulfide generation extends healthspan and lifespan in mammals remains unknown. Here, we investigated the in vivo effects of the non-enzymatic hydrogen sulfide generation promoted by natural diallyl sulforated compounds. Diallyl sulforated compounds extended lifespan and improved the main aspects of healthspan, including glucoregulation, locomotor function, and neurocognition in wild-type male mice across their lifespan. At the histological and molecular levels, we observed reductions in hepatic lipid-droplet size, attenuation of transcriptional and proteomic signatures associated with mTOR and immune-related pathways, and increased cysteine persulfidation in proteins. In humans, greater protein persulfidation in individuals with polypathological conditions was associated with increased muscle strength and lower triglyceride levels, supporting its physiological relevance. Our findings uncover the potential of enhanced hydrogen sulfide generation to promote healthy aging.",

    "title": "Serotonin-licensed macrophages potentiate chemoresistance via inositol metabolic crosstalk in ovarian cancer.",
    "abstract": "Therapeutic resistance in solid tumors frequently stems from enhanced homologous recombination (HR) repair capacity, yet systemic regulators of this pathway remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a serotonin-sensitive tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulation that orchestrates inositol metabolic crosstalk to potentiate HR repair in cancer cells. This TAM subset exhibited marked enrichment in ovarian tumors with low response to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, peripheral serotonin activates these TAMs via serotonin receptor HTR7, triggering extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion enriched with inositol metabolic enzymes PI4K2A and ITPKC. EV-mediated transfer of these metabolic enzymes elevates nuclear inositol-1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate (IP4) in cancer cells, where IP4 directly binds MRE11 and facilitates MRE11-DNA binding and HR repair. Attenuating peripheral serotonin using fluoxetine-a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant-ablates TAM-derived EV delivering of inositol metabolic enzymes and sensitizes tumors to cisplatin/PARP inhibitor (PARPi). Our study unveils a systemic serotonin-primed metabolic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment that potentiates chemoresistance, revealing targetable HR repair regulation beyond cancer-cell-autonomous mechanisms.",

    "title": "Bile acids regulate lipid metabolism through selective actions on fatty acid absorption.",
    "abstract": "Intestinal lipid absorption, the entry point for fats into the body, requires the coordinated actions of bile acids and lipases. Here, we uncover distinct yet cooperative roles of bile acids in driving the differential uptake of dietary fatty acids. We first decreased the bile acid pool size by disrupting the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, Cyp7a1, using liver-directed gene editing in mice. Compared with lipase inhibition, reduced bile acids prevented diet-induced obesity, increased anorectic hormones, suppressed excessive eating, and improved systemic lipid metabolism. Remarkably, decreasing bile acids selectively reduced the absorption of saturated fatty acids but preserved polyunsaturated fatty acids. By targeting additional bile acid enzymes, we identified specific functions of individual bile acid species. Mechanistically, we show that cholic acid preferentially solubilizes polyunsaturated fatty acids into mixed micelles for intestinal uptake. Our studies demonstrate that bile acids can selectively control fatty acid uptake, revealing insights for future interventions in metabolic diseases.",

    "title": "Excessive vigorous exercise impairs cognitive function through a muscle-derived mitochondrial pretender.",
    "abstract": "Excessive exercise impairs cognitive function, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that excessive vigorous exercise-induced lactate accumulation stimulates muscles to secrete mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs), driving cognitive impairment. These MDVs (named otMDVs) are characterized by high mtDNA levels and the surface marker PAF. They tend to migrate into hippocampal neurons, substituting endogenous mitochondria and triggering a synaptic energy crisis. Mechanistically, otMDVs release mtDNA, which activates cGAS-STING-dependent inhibition of kinesin family member 5, preventing hippocampal mitochondria from transporting to synapses. Simultaneously, the otMDV marker PAF cooperates with syntaphilin to occupy mitochondrial anchoring sites, impairing synaptic energy supply. Blocking otMDVs migration into the hippocampus with a PAF-neutralizing antibody alleviates excessive vigorous exercise-induced synapse loss and cognitive dysfunction. Notably, human studies link high circulating otMDV levels to cognitive impairment. Together, our findings reveal that a unique muscle-derived MDV subpopulation, which displaces hippocampal mitochondria and disrupts their function, causes cognitive decline.",

Answering this could reveal new mechanisms of aging and therapeutics. Here, we profile metabolic changes in 12 organs in male and female mice at 5 different ages. We also develop organ-specific metabolic aging clocks that identify metabolic drivers of aging, including alpha-ketoglutarate, previously shown to extend lifespan in mice. We also use the clocks to uncover that carglumic acid is a potential driver of aging and show that it is synthesized by human cells. Finally, we validate that hydroxyproline decreases with age in the human pancreas, emphasizing that our approach reveals insights across species. This study reveals fundamental insights into the aging process and identifies new therapeutic targets to maintain organ health.",
