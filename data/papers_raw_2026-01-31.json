    "abstract": "The small GTPase Rab9 plays a major role in the vesicular trafficking of mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR). CI-M6PR trafficking has also been reported to be perturbed by dysfunction of a ubiquitin ligase necessary for protein quality control (PQC). However, the mechanism underlying the participation of the PQC machinery in CI-M6PR trafficking is poorly understood. In this study, we found an extremely short half-life of GDP-bound Rab9, which is in clear contrast to its phylogenetically closest relative, Rab7. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these relatives revealed that hydrophobic residues are specifically exposed in the Switch I region of Rab9a and that these residues are recognized by the PQC machinery. We defined this exposed hydrophobicity as a conformation-dependent hydrophobic (CDH) degron because its existence determines the instability of Rab proteins in a nucleotide-dependent manner. CDH degron-mediated instability is essential for Rab9a function, given that forced accumulation of CDH degron-mutated Rab9a in cells resulted in the defective localization of CI-M6PR, a similar phenotype observed in PQC dysfunction. Thus, the CDH degron-driven PQC system is necessary for the proper vesicular trafficking of CI-M6PR. We also identified VCP/p97 as a CDH degron-dependent PQC factor for GDP-bound Rab9a.",

    "abstract": "Chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), a regulator of immune cell migration, has been implicated in various cancers but remains poorly characterized in gastric cancer's immune microenvironment. This study aimed to investigate whether CCR1 promotes or suppresses tumor progression in gastric cancer.\nUtilize transcriptomic analysis to investigate the role of CCR1 in gastric cancer, and employed clinical data to examine the correlation between CCR1 expression and patient survival as well as pathological features. In vivo models with CCR1-knockout mice and macrophage depletion experiments validated functional roles, while Western blotting and qRT-PCR explored The pathways and signaling.\nFollowing patient stratification based on optimal cut-off values, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with high CCR1 expression had longer survival times. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses revealed that CCR1 is predominantly expressed on macrophages. Immunofluorescence assays showed greater co-localization of CCR1 and CD68 in gastric cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, confirming CCR1 expression in macrophages. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CCR1 deficiency increased tumor growth by reducing T cell infiltration, an effect that was abrogated by macrophage depletion. Mechanistically, CCR1 activates the NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways in macrophages to upregulate CXCL9 and CXCL10, thereby promoting T cell recruitment to the tumor microenvironment.\nCCR1 modulates T cell distribution via CXCL9/CXCL10, suggesting potential therapeutic directions.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1 occur in 10%-40% of prostate cancers and broadly alter chromatin accessibility. In a cohort of 874 primary and metastatic tumors, we confirm frequent Wing2 missense mutations and indels, as well as C-terminal truncating frameshifts. To define their functional impact, we performed single-nucleus multiome profiling in mouse prostate organoids expressing representative alleles, including overexpressed wild-type FOXA1. Each subgroup produces distinct chromatin and transcriptional changes, but all perturb epithelial lineage specification. Indel mutants promote basal-like states, whereas C-terminal truncations, Wing2 missense mutations, and elevated wild-type FOXA1 drive secretory L1-like luminal fates. Integrated RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq reveal that L1-like specification involves a hybrid androgen receptor/FOXA1 motif and cooperation with POU2F1. In vivo, these same alleles, combined with Trp53/Pten loss, shift tumor histology from basal-like to secretory luminal phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Hosts can use avoidance (e.g., behavior) to reduce their contact rates with pathogens; after contact, they can use resistance (e.g., immunity) to reduce the establishment and proliferation of an infection. Because both defenses preserve host fitness and reduce pathogen fitness, we expect that their epidemiological and evolutionary effects will be interdependent. This study used a two-locus model to understand the evolution of allelic associations (i.e., linkage disequilibrium or LD) between genes determining levels of avoidance and resistance in the presence of an infectious disease or a parasite.\nWe found that polymorphism in both avoidance and resistance was possible, but only for a limited range of parameter values. At equilibrium within these polymorphic populations, avoidance and resistance alleles were negatively associated (i.e., in negative LD). However, most commonly, polymorphism was only stably maintained at one defense locus, and the other locus became fixed for one allele.\nThe model shows that avoidance and resistance are likely to influence each other's evolution because of their joint effects on infection and their costs; however, predictions about their relationship are not necessarily straightforward or intuitive. For example, avoidance and resistance may be more likely to covary across than within populations.",

This study investigated the mechanism linking eIF6 deficiency, microbial dysbiosis, and colorectal cancer (CRC). eIF6 expression was assessed in human and mouse CRC samples. Functional assays were conducted in mice with AOM/DSS-induced CRC. Antibiotic treatment and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) were applied to evaluate microbiota-mediated effects. 16S rDNA sequencing and Dubosiella newyorkensis (D. newyorkensis) supplementation were used to identify key bacteria. Metabolites from the bacterial supernatant were analysed via targeted mass spectrometry. The effect of indole-3-carboxaldehyde (3-ICA) was tested in murine models. eIF6 expression was upregulated in CRC. Its deficiency reduced the tumour incidence and proliferation of tumours in mice and increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia and Dubosiella. FMT from eIF6 deficient mice and D. newyorkensis administration attenuated tumorigenesis and enhanced barrier function. 3-ICA, a metabolite of D. newyorkensis, also suppressed CRC progression. eIF6 deficiency exerts protective effects against CRC through the enrichment of D. newyorkensis and its metabolite 3-ICA, revealing a novel mechanism and potential therapeutic strategy for CRC.",

    "abstract": "People with a cancer signal detected via multi-cancer early detection (MCED) screening need timely access to confirmatory diagnostic testing. We estimated the likely change in demand for diagnostic testing in England if MCED screening were introduced.\nDiagnostic demand was modelled based on (1) estimates of the volume of people aged 50-79 years who would be referred for diagnostic investigation following a 'cancer signal detected' result after MCED screening and (2) MCED test performance metrics. Predicted usage was compared with current annual usage using routine NHS datasets.\nIn an established MCED screening programme, assuming 70% of the total eligible population is screened annually (~13 million), the relative change in diagnostic demand was greatest for colonoscopy (+2.09%; +13,730 each year); the greatest absolute change was for computed tomography (CT; +0.76%; +62,320). This equates to +1040 colonoscopies and +4720 CT scans for every million screened.\nThe predicted relative increase in diagnostic testing generated by MCED screening is small, though a large eligible population and maximum uptake could translate into a large number of procedures. Cancer diagnoses brought forward in time through screening should reduce diagnostic use for symptomatic presentations in the future.",

Yet, the extent of their transcriptional activity in human tissues and the features that govern their regulatory potential remain unclear. Here, we integrated high-resolution RAMPAGE data from 115 human biosamples to construct a comprehensive atlas of 26,056 transcription start sites derived from transposable elements. These sites contribute to tissue-specific gene expression, with a notable fraction originating from primate- and hominid-specific elements. Transposable element-derived transcription start sites exhibit focused, narrow-peak architectures enriched for TATA boxes and depleted of CpG islands. Phylogenetic analyses reveal a continuous gradient in promoter strength and transcriptional precision across transposable element subfamilies, with evolutionarily younger elements retaining intrinsic promoter motifs that drive focused and robust transcription, whereas older, more divergent elements exhibit broader initiation patterns and lower intrinsic activity. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how the evolution and preservation of promoter features shape the capacity of transposable elements to be exapted as functional promoters, potentially contributing to lineage-specific regulatory innovation in primates.",

Nevertheless, insights into multi-axis atropisomerism remain limited. This work presents a systematic investigation of three classes of LaPlente-type biaxial atropisomers based on naphthalene rotors and phenyl linkers. Thermodynamically and kinetically controlled interconversion of molecular conformations is achieved in 22-NB, 11-NB, and 11-NB-8DMe. Concurrently, a direct correlation between molecular dynamics and electronic through-space conjugation (TSC) is elucidated. Furthermore, absolute separation of syn and anti conformers is accomplished in 11-NB-2DMe, whose distinct TSC-induced fluorescence enables direct visualization of dynamic conformer populations and kinetics during temporally sequential crystallization. This work provides fundamental mechanistic insights into multi-axis atropisomer stereochemistry and establishes a fluorescence-based approach as an in-situ platform for real-time analysis of molecular dynamics across life and materials sciences.",

However, under realistic conditions, which often include environmental and surface charge variations, the interfacial water structure remains elusive. Here we overcome this limit by combining three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM) and interface-sensitive shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) to characterize the graphite-water interfacial structure in situ. Through correlative analysis of the spatial liquid density maps and vibrational peaks within \u22482\u2009nm of the graphite surface, we find the existence of two interfacial configurations at open circuit potential, a transient state where pristine water exhibits strong hydrogen bond (H-bond) breaking effects, and a steady state with hydrocarbons dominating the interface and weak H-bond breaking in the surrounding water. At sufficiently negative potentials, both states transition into a stable structure featuring pristine water with a broader distribution of H-bond configurations. Our three-state model resolves many long-standing controversies on interfacial water structure.",

    "abstract": "Treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem and precursor cells (GPCs) drive glioblastoma (GBM) growth and recurrence. Thus, targeting the molecular machinery that sustains GPCs in an undifferentiated and self-renewing state is a promising therapeutic strategy. The transcription factor SOX21 effectively suppresses the tumorigenic capacity of GPCs, but the mechanism by which SOX21 impedes GPC features is unknown. By engineering patient-derived GPCs with a transgenic TetOn system we show that SOX21 expression induces an anti-tumorigenic transcriptional program, aligning with clinical data demonstrating a positive correlation between SOX21 levels and improved GBM patient survival. Induced SOX21 expression in GPCs within pre-established GBM reduces their capacity to sustain tumor growth and significantly extends the survival of the orthotopically transplanted mice. Mechanistically, SOX21 functions as a tumor suppressor by binding a large set of AP-1-targeted chromatin regions, leading to epigenetic repression of AP-1-activated genes. Consistently, the anti-tumorigenic activities of SOX21 are largely replicated by AP-1 inhibitors, which decrease GPC proliferation and survival, while overexpression of the AP-1 family member, c-JUN, counteracts these effects. Our findings identify SOX21 as a key regulator that prevents GPC malignancy by targeting and repressing an AP-1-driven, tumor-promoting gene expression program. These results highlight SOX21-regulated pathways as promising therapeutic targets for GBM.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution has been increasingly linked to a wide range of diseases, yet the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate how circulating proteins mediate the health effects of multiple air pollutants and quantify individual susceptibility. Using large-scale data from the UK Biobank, we identify 30 diseases significantly associated with air pollution exposure. We uncover 1,089 pollutant-associated proteins enriched in immune pathways, among which 296 significantly mediate disease risk. Notably, the mediating pathways of air pollution vary by disease types, involving MAPK signaling in cardiovascular diseases, innate immunity in immune disorders, carbohydrate metabolism in metabolic diseases, and cell proliferation in respiratory conditions. Globally, the proteome mediates 23.69% of the association between air pollution and diseases. Based on these mediators, we develop an Air Pollution Protein Risk Score (APPRS), which shows robust associations with disease risk in the UKBB and two external validation cohorts. APPRS also improves disease prediction when integrated into baseline models. Collectively, our study highlights the central role of circulating proteins in mediating the health impacts of air pollution and introduces APPRS as a tool for personalized risk assessment and precision public health interventions.",

    "abstract": "Oligonucleotide multiplicity is an inherent property of current DNA synthesis technology. Composite letter DNA storage exploits this property to improve logical density and reduce costs. However, letter indistinguishability and high molecular diversity pose challenges for reliable recovery. Here, we formulate a composite letter constellation model, named DNA diamond, consisting of 15 decomposable points. Inspired by set partitioning in telecommunications, we propose a two-stage letter detection framework that partitions these letters into four distinguishable subsets based on their discrete entropy. Furthermore, we incorporate encoded double-end indices to eliminate crosstalk between synthesis sites and simultaneously apply length filtering to suppress error propagation during readout. We validate the eight-letter and 15-letter composite letter DNA storage under DNA diamond model, each with 10,000 composite strands. The eight-letter system achieves a payload density of 2.5 bits per letter and enables error-free recovery at 14\u00d7 coverage, surpassing the storage density of prior six-letter systems while requiring lower coverage. The full 15-letter constellation enables 3.125 bits per letter for payload with error-free recovery at 33\u00d7 coverage, corresponding to a density of 2.23 bits per letter for payload plus indices. The proposed decomposable DNA diamond model advances a practical and scalable framework for high-density composite DNA data storage.",

Existing approaches for generating circularly polarized emission primarily rely on nanostructures with true chirality, where the far-field polarization at the \u0393 point is believed to require out-of-plane symmetry breaking. This raises a question: can an intrinsically achiral metasurface that preserves out-of-plane symmetry generate chiral emission? Here, we introduce the concept of anisotropic continuum, defined as a continuum state exhibiting distinct responses for orthogonal polarizations of incidence, as a new degree of freedom for intrinsically achiral metasurfaces. In such metasurfaces, chiral emission arises from manipulating the anisotropic continuum together with the metasurface's in-plane perturbations. Degrees of circular polarization of 0.83 for upward emission and -0.9 for downward emission are achieved experimentally by integrating the fabricated silicon metasurface with fluorescent organic dyes. Our findings not only address a long-standing gap in the understanding of structural chirality, but also open new opportunities for high-performance applications in polarized fluorescence and thermal emission.",

    "abstract": "Fragment-based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a proven methodology for the discovery of new therapeutics. After the identification of small molecular fragments, subsequent steps are guided by the \"Design, Make, Test\" (DMT) cycle. During the \"Design\" phase, chemical modifications are proposed that generate Structure-Activity Relationship information, improve interaction profiles and physicochemical properties. In the \"Make\" phase, designs are synthesised into viable compounds, with an emphasis on feasibility, scalability and the incorporation of novel chemistries enabling broad chemical space sampling. Finally, the \"Test\" phase evaluates these compounds through a series of assays, identifying binders and enabling Structure-Activity Relationship models that guide subsequent designs. Within DMT cycles, fragment progression - the process of converting initial hits into more potent follow-up lead compounds - is an essential component, but has many challenges associated with it. Here, we review such challenges along with recent developments designed to mitigate them.",

    "abstract": "Conventional coherent light-field manipulation techniques inherently conflict with the spatiotemporal incoherence of thermal radiation sources. While recent advances in thermophotonics have facilitated directional thermal emission, arbitrary thermal wavefront control-a cornerstone for advanced functionalities like focusing and holography-remains an unaddressed challenge. Here, we report a generalized recipe of designing meta-emitters with lossy and lossless outer boundaries, that enables thermal emission with arbitrarily tailored wavefront. Lossy and lossless surfaces on two sides of the meta-emitter are synergistically coupled by a single-mode waveguide, transforming incoherent thermal photons to coherent surface waves for wavefront shaping functionalities. Designer surface mode of meta-emitter permits the independent optimization of photon lifetime and propagation length, thus enabling scalable spatial coherence engineering. For the proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate near-diffraction-limited self-focusing emission, quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) high-quality thermal holography without speckle noise and spatial-multiplexed holography. Coupling optimization further suggests that spatial coherence exceeding 1000\u03bb",

    "abstract": "Heterotopic ossification (HO), the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissues, is a debilitating complication that occurs after severe burns, trauma, and joint replacement surgery. Current diagnostic methods detect HO only after substantial progression, limiting opportunities for early intervention. In this study, we show that circulating mesenchymal progenitor cells (cMPCs), isolated using a microfluidic iChip from patients undergoing hip replacement and a mouse model of traumatic HO, exhibit HO-associated gene expression as early as 6\u2009hours post-injury-41 days before radiographic detection. RNA sequencing of cMPCs enabled development of a liquid biopsy-based HO risk prediction model, achieving up to 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity in human subjects. Furthermore, the model detected significant reductions in HO risk following prophylactic treatment, correlating with decreased HO volume. These findings establish a noninvasive platform for early detection and monitoring of HO and suggest broader utility for diseases involving aberrant mesenchymal cell fate. This approach enables high-throughput screening of at-risk patients and real-time assessment of therapeutic efficacy.",

Most chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems respond to exogenous molecules, limiting integration with endogenous signaling.

Using the LBDs of TR\u03b2, VDR, RAR\u03b3, ER\u03b2, and GR2 with a TIF2 coactivator peptide, we constructed CIDs responsive to triiodothyronine, vitamin D, retinoic acid, estrogen, cortisol, and their antagonists. These CIDs enable two-input transcriptional switches for gene regulation. Furthermore, we design hormone-responsive liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS) condensates that strongly amplify transcription when exceeding a critical interaction threshold. These functional LLPS condensates provide a tunable platform for transcriptional control with up to several hundred-fold activation. Our findings offer an approach for integrating synthetic biology with physiological signaling, advancing applications in gene circuits, biosensing, and therapeutics through ligand-controlled LLPS formation.",

We created new interdomain linkers, optimised scFv domain orientation and found an optimisable charge discrepancy between variable heavy framework and CDR sites. When applied to reduce the search space and rank the products of AI-led inverse folding this creates a single highly soluble, abundant and stable intrabody with parent antibody epitope recognition. Over six hundred intrabody sequences are presented targeting sixty cytoplasmic proteins with linear, conformational, post-translational modification or oligomer specificity.

    "abstract": "The discovery of KRAS G12C inactive state inhibitors represented a significant advancement in the field of precision oncology. While inactive state inhibition shows promise in patients, Switch II (SWII)-binding inhibitors targeting both inactive and active states remain an underdeveloped therapeutic modality. Here, we describe the discovery of such KRAS G12C dual inhibitors that bind the SWII allosteric site using a chemically differentiated warhead to covalently modify both\u00a0the KRAS G12C inactive and active states. Co-crystal structures reveal that these inhibitors perturb a key water-mediated hydrogen bonding network and trigger allosteric remodeling of the GTP-bound protein surface and SWI that prevents binding to downstream effectors. Consistent with simultaneous targeting of the active and inactive states, dual inhibitors provide rapid covalent target engagement and suppression of MAPK signaling. However, they demonstrate similar efficacy in cellular and in vivo models\u00a0when compared to inactive state-selective ones despite faster target inactivation. Furthermore, both inhibitor classes show similar cellular efficacy in the presence of growth factors that drive KRAS, wt NRAS, and wt HRAS to the active state. These data provide the first detailed account of targeting both the active and inactive states of KRAS G12C and highlight the absence of a mechanistic advantage in contexts dependent on prolonged target inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a highly aggressive pediatric malignancy characterized by elevated expression of SLFN11, which impairs DNA repair by binding to and functionally inhibiting DNA repair complexes, thereby enhancing susceptibility to genotoxic therapies. However, relapse remains a major clinical challenge and is often accompanied by the emergence of therapeutic resistance linked to reduced SLFN11 expression. We hypothesized that SLFN11-deficient tumors undergo adaptive metabolic reprogramming to overcome chemosensitivity. Here, we leverage transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling in patient-derived EWS models to demonstrate that SLFN11 loss drives downregulated mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD2) expression, higher accumulation of glycerol-3-phosphate, fatty acid unsaturation, and enhanced glycerophospholipid (GPL) biosynthesis. Subsequently, targeting GPL biosynthesis (FSG67) restored DNA-damaging agent (SN-38) sensitivity in SLFN11-deficient EWS model, revealing a potential metabolic vulnerability to overcome chemoresistance. Furthermore, SLFN11 knockout tumors exhibited an elevated phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine ratio, offering a potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Plastics are a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss, with packaging accounting for around 40% of European plastic production. Bio-based plastics are often promoted as a climate-friendly alternative, yet their broader environmental implications remain unclear. Here, we conduct a harmonized life cycle assessment of fossil- and bio-based plastic packaging, integrating end-of-life fate and plastic leakage. We find that while bio-based plastics reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they increase ecosystem damage, primarily driven by land use. At the product level, outcomes are sensitive to feedstock origin and waste management. When mismanaged, environmentally persistent bio-based plastics contribute substantially to ecosystem damage. Scaling scenarios for Europe show that even complete substitution with bio-based plastics cannot offset the environmental burden of continued demand growth. Only strong demand-side measures, particularly demand reduction and improved circularity, can mitigate trade-offs across climate change and biodiversity, calling for a shift from material substitution to systemic interventions in production and consumption.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical immobilization of multicomponent biomacromolecules has been demonstrated to be a favorable protocol for constructing advanced biopharmaceuticals, but still with formidable challenges. Herein, we innovate a multicomponent synergistic immobilization approach combining an in-situ method with a structural-transformation-promoted dynamic exchange method in a flexible zeolitic pyrimidine framework (ZPF) platform to construct multicomponent biopharmaceuticals. In-depth mechanism investigation reveals that special functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, sulfhydryl, imidazolyl) on protein surface can significantly promote the dynamic structural transformation of ZPF and allow for the efficient immobilization of proteins on the surface of ZPF crystals via dynamic exchange approach. By combining with the in-situ method, which can immobilize biomacromolecules in the inner part of ZPF crystals, multicomponent biomacromolecules can be regionally localized within ZPF crystals. This controlled spatial preparation provides substantial advantages over conventional core-shell architectures for cascading enzyme immobilization and enables the development of advanced anticancer agents demonstrating enhanced therapeutic efficacy for female Balb/c nu mice. Moreover, this platform can also generate highly efficient hierarchical antibacterial formulations to significantly enhance the wound-healing process of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. This study provides a revolution to immobilize multicomponent biomacromolecules and represents an innovative and effective platform of biopharmaceuticals with immense potential for anticancer and antibacterial formulations.",

    "abstract": "Despite the ubiquity of recurrent connections in the brain, their role in visual processing is less understood than that of feedforward connections. Occluded object recognition, an important cognitive capacity, is thought to rely on recurrent processing of visual information, but it remains unclear whether and how recurrent processing improves recognition of occluded objects. Using convolutional models of the visual system, we demonstrate how a distinct form of computation arises in recurrent-but not feedforward-networks that leverages information about the occluder to \"explain-away\" the occlusion-i.e., recognition of the occluder provides an account for missing or altered features, potentially rescuing recognition of occluded objects. This occurs without any constraint placed on the computation and is observed both across a systematic architecture sweep of convolutional models and in a model explicitly constructed to approximate the primate visual system. In line with these results, we find evidence consistent with explaining-away in a human psychophysics experiment. Finally, we developed an experimentally inspired recurrent model that recovers fine-grained features of occluded stimuli by explaining-away. Recurrent connections' capability to explain-away may extend to more general cases where undoing context-dependent changes in representations benefits perception.",

    "abstract": "Viral diseases critically impact crop yields, necessitating insights into plant-pathogen recognition and resistance. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), tomato chlorosis virus\u00a0(ToCV) employs 59\u2009kDa protein (p59) to facilitate movement and degrade the host Catalase1 (SlCAT1), disrupting redox homeostasis. Importantly, tomato has evolved an antiviral ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) featuring the Antiviral E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (SlAVE2) and Antiviral E3 ubiquitin ligase (SlAVE3) pair, which specifically recognizes p59 to trigger antiviral defenses. During infection, this system ubiquitinates SlWRKY6, alleviating its repression of SlAVE3 and creating a positive feedback loop that enhances SlAVE3 expression. SlAVE3 then targets p59 for ubiquitination and degradation, inhibiting viral spread. Notably, p59 co-opts this UPS to degrade SlCAT1, illustrating a counter-defense interplay. Domestication analysis reveals selection of AVE3 from S. pimpinellifolium to S. lycopersicum, with SpAVE3 conferring stronger ToCV resistance than SlAVE3 through improved p59 targeting and reduced SlCAT1 degradation. This study unveils a domesticated antiviral UPS, providing a foundation for breeding ToCV-resistant tomatoes.",

However, the weak MXene interlayer bonding often causes film fracturing under mechanical strain, ultimately leading to device failure, manifested as unstable operation, inaccurate data transmission, and potential electrical disconnection. Here, we present strain-invariant, omnidirectionally stretchable MXetronics (sos-MXetronics) through hierarchical stiffness microgrid engineering. This strategy synergistically integrates patterned elastiff regions and modulus-buffered interconnects, effectively preventing performance shifts in sos-MXetronics. This circular sos-MXetronics with a radius of 3.3\u2009cm integrates a near-field communication (NFC) antenna, eight micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), three resistive sensors, and interconnected conductive networks, demonstrating exceptional strain invariance with 95-98% performance retention even under 40% strain. With the capability to minimize motion-induced artifacts, the system ensures accurate blood pressure (BP) monitoring without electrical disconnection, even during wrist deformations. This breakthrough not only marks a significant step toward the practical application of MXene in omnidirectional stretchable MXetronics, but also paves the way for reliable, high-performance electronics based on two-dimensional materials for next-generation healthcare monitoring systems that seamlessly integrate with the human body under real-world conditions.",

We combine in situ sequencing, single-cell transcriptomics, and 3D vascular reconstruction to map zebrafish brain endothelial development (3-11 dpf). Quantitative 3D analysis reveals a developmental shift from lateral vascularization to intraparenchymal angiogenesis, coinciding with blood-brain barrier (BBB) maturation. We identify 6 endothelial subtypes with conserved mammalian signatures, showing capillary endothelial cells (CapECs), the predominant intracranial subtype exhibiting stage-specific enrichment of transporter and tight junction modules. Spatial transcriptomics show progressive CapEC enrichment in mesencephalic/metencephalic regions versus arterial EC accumulation in prosencephalic vessels. Functional assays confirm BBB competency by 11 dpf, while genetic perturbation of three uncharacterized CapEC-enriched genes (slc16a1a, zgc:158423, cldc1) disrupts vascular patterning and BBB integrity.

The dice lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at E",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) acquires malignant traits through complex molecular adaptations that sustain immune evasion, often characterized by hypoxia and overexpression of the phagocytosis checkpoint CD47. However, the role of hypoxic drivers coordinating CD47-dependent immune evasion remains poorly defined. Here, we integrated single cell RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis to identify that insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was co-expressed with CD47 in hypoxic mesenchymal-like GBM subpopulations, synergistically promoting tumor progression and immune evasion. Mechanically, hypoxia induced IGFBP2 expression via HIF-2\u03b1-mediated transcriptional activation and further increased IGFBP2-positive exosome secretion through HIF-1\u03b1-dependent RAB3A upregulation. Moreover, IGFBP2 was predominantly localized on the exosome surface via integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and activated integrin/FAK/STAT3 signaling to enhance CD47 expression and inhibit macrophage phagocytosis. Clinically, serum exosomal IGFBP2 levels correlated with tumor grade and could serve as a diagnostic biomarker. Importantly, combinatorial blockade of IGFBP2 and CD47 synergistically suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in orthotopic GBM models. Together, our findings uncovered the hypoxia-exosomal IGFBP2-CD47 axis in GBM immune evasion and provided a compelling rationale for combination therapy to improve immunotherapy efficacy in GBM.",

    "title": "BCL-xL as a therapeutic target in cetuximab-refractory colorectal cancer.",
    "abstract": "Despite recent medical advances, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. For patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic CRC, the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is an approved treatment option. However, therapeutic success is often limited by the emergence of drug-resistant cancer cell populations within a few months. Therefore, alternative strategies to effectively target cetuximab-refractory CRC are urgently needed. Here, we sought to identify second-line therapeutic strategies using a CRC cell line with acquired cetuximab resistance as a model. Transcriptomic profiling of the resistant cells identified the apoptosis pathway as a potential therapeutic target, which was supported by their increased susceptibility to BH3-mimetics targeting the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and BCL-xL under both 2D and 3D culture conditions. These findings were validated in organotypic CRC slice cultures generated from cetuximab-resistant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Multiplex immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that BCL-xL inhibition effectively triggered apoptosis in heterogeneous PDX tumor slice models, including models harboring oncogenic BRAF mutations. Our findings suggest that cetuximab-resistant CRC retains apoptotic competence, and that BCL-xL inhibition serves as a robust alternative therapeutic strategy that is largely independent of the tumor mutational profile.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoid diversity arises from modifications of a few precursors by tailored enzymes, yet the complexity of their evolved metabolic networks complicates pathway elucidation and design. Here, by combining chromosome-scale genome assembly with large-scale transcriptome analysis, we identify and reconstruct the glabridin biosynthetic pathway in yeast, enabling de novo production of this antioxidant flavonoid from Glycyrrhiza glabra L. By analyzing 183 licorice transcriptomes, we discover four classes of enzymes capable of modify isoflavan scaffolds. Among 13 theoretical routes, we validate six functional pathways, revealing a ladder-like, multi-route tailoring network. This network features a multi-step \"protection-deprotection\" mechanism driven by a dynamic methylation-demethylation cycle that regulate intermediate hydrophilicity and enzyme affinity, thereby enabling species-specific glabridin synthesis. Reconstruction of this network in yeast shows that metabolic redundancy and interconnectivity enhance robustness and yield compared to single-route designs. These results establish a biosynthetic paradigm with broad implications for natural product discovery and biomanufacturing.",

    "title": "SLC46A1 deficiency-mediated folate restriction suppresses colorectal cancer progression through epigenetic-transcriptional reprogramming.",
    "abstract": "The association between folate metabolism abnormalities and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains controversial. Here, we report that the folate exerts a tumor-suppressive role in CRC; however, the manifestation of this effect is restricted by the expression level of folate transporter SLC46A1 in CRC cells. Multi-cohort profiling revealed significant downregulation of SLC46A1 in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, where low expression independently predicted poor overall survival. Functional studies demonstrated that SLC46A1-mediated folate uptake suppressed tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SLC46A1 deficiency restricted intracellular folate availability and impaired cellular methylation potential, as evidenced by a reduced SAM/SAH ratio, leading to DNA hypomethylation at specific sites such as the FOS proto-oncogene promoter. This epigenetic reprogramming triggers transcriptional activation of key oncogenic effectors CCND1, BCL2, and PLAU involved in CRC progression. Clinically, we found a significant inverse correlation between SLC46A1 expression and folate levels in tumor interstitial fluids of CRC, suggesting impaired folate uptake in low SLC46A1 tumors. Multi-color immunofluorescence across two cohorts further demonstrated conserved inverse associations between SLC46A1 and FOS expression in primary tumors and metastatic lesions. This study elucidates the molecular mechanism by which folate inhibits CRC progression through the \"SLC46A1-epigenetic-transcriptional regulation\" axis, providing mechanistic insights into folate deficiency-driven CRC progression and biomarkers for precision CRC intervention. This study elucidates the tumor-suppressive role of the folate transporter SLC46A1 in CRC. In normal cells, SLC46A1 facilitates folate uptake, supporting one-carbon metabolism and maintaining genomic stability. In CRC, however, SLC46A1 downregulation induces intracellular folate deficiency, triggering locus-specific DNA hypomethylation at the FOS promoter, which activates oncogenic transcription of key downstream effectors (CCND1, BCL2, PLAU), driving tumor progression. The graphical abstract illustrates the differential impact of SLC46A1 on folate metabolism and gene expression in normal versus tumor cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC.",

    "abstract": "Aeromonads are an ecologically versatile group of bacteria that cause infections in aquatic animals and are recognised as emerging human pathogens. Despite this, our understanding of Aeromonas diversity, especially the relationship between clinical and environmental strains, remains limited. Here, we present a genomic analysis of the Aeromonas genus, comprising 1853 genomes, and a detailed comparison of clinical and environmental strains from South Asia, including 996 newly sequenced genomes from Bangladesh and India. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Aeromonas is a highly diverse genus, with no distinct clade separating clinical and environmental isolates. We identified 28 Aeromonas species and 905 novel sequence types, comprising 72.5% of the genomes. Notably, we show a high incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes across all isolates, including against front and last-line antibiotics. Finally, we highlight frequent misidentification of Aeromonas as Vibrio cholerae, which is relevant to cholera-endemic regions where both genera co-exist and are associated with diarrhoeal disease. Our study underscores Aeromonas as an important environmental AMR reservoir and emerging multi-species pathogen capable of spilling over into human populations.",

    "title": "Targeting the USP7-PRMT6 epigenetic axis overcomes chemoresistance in breast cancer by coordinating H3R2me2a deposition and RNF168 methylation for DNA repair and ferroptosis blockade.",
    "abstract": "Platinum resistance in breast cancer remains a major therapeutic challenge due to convergent escape mechanisms. Here, we identify the PRMT6/USP7 complex as a dual epigenetic orchestrator of chemoresistance. Mechanistically, USP7-mediated deubiquitination of H2BK120ub facilitates PRMT6-dependent deposition of the repressive mark H3R2me2a, concomitant with the exclusion of activating H3K4me3. This coordinated histone crosstalk reprograms the chromatin landscape, leading to transcriptional silencing of the ferroptosis regulator TAZ (WWTR1). Consequently, TAZ suppression disrupts lipid peroxidation and blocks cisplatin-induced ferroptosis, a critical cell death pathway. Simultaneously, the PRMT6/USP7 complex recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 to sites of DNA damage, promoting H2AX monoubiquitination and robust activation of both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathways, thereby enhancing DNA damage tolerance. To translate this mechanism, we engineered an injectable hydrogel for the sequential co-delivery of cisplatin and PRMT6/USP7 inhibitors, demonstrating significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Our study unveils a previously unrecognized bifunctional role for the PRMT6-USP7 axis in orchestrating epigenetic reprogramming and DNA repair to confer platinum resistance, providing profound mechanistic insights and a compelling co-targeting strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in breast cancer.",
