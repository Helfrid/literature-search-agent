    "title": "Pan-tumor harmonization of pathologic response assessment for standardized data collection in neoadjuvant trials (PATHdata): Results of a Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer multi-institutional reproducibility study.",
    "abstract": "Pathologic response is an emerging surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy and long-term patient outcomes. Updated guidelines for pan-tumor pathologic response assessment have recently been adopted for ongoing clinical trials and routine clinical care. The goal of this study was to prospectively evaluate the interobserver variability amongst pathologists in assessments of treatment response across tumor types, anatomic locations, and specimen types.\nA multi-institutional, international study led by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer was performed to assess the concordance of pathologic response assessment using the pan-tumor criteria in neoadjuvant-treated resection specimens and on-treatment biopsies. Online lecture-based modules for scoring were developed, and 14 pathologists from multiple institutions were trained. The pathologists then assessed 42 specimens representing 12 different tumor types (total of n=362 H&E-stained slides) for the three tissue classes that are assessed: %residual viable tumor (RVT), %regression, and %necrosis. Pathologists were also surveyed regarding interest in and barriers related to pan-tumor pathologic response assessment as well as quality and effectiveness of the training materials.\nScoring of pathologic response using the pan-tumor system was highly reproducible, irrespective of disease location (primary tumor vs. lymph node) or specimen type (resection vs. biopsy), with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) >0.8 for %RVT, %regression, and %necrosis. Subset analyses also showed strong reproducibility of %RVT within almost all individual tumor types evaluated (ICC all >0.86). The post-study survey completed by the participating pathologists was used to refine the training materials, and the revised modules are provided as a resource to the wider pathology and oncology communities.\nThis highly reproducible scoring system enables quantitative assessment of treatment response in pathology specimens across multiple tumor types, anatomic sites, disease stages, and therapies, akin to RECIST for radiographic assessment. We identified potential barriers to implementation and highlight strategies to overcome these challenges.",

    "title": "Progress in Targeting the Untouchables: Emerging Approaches for Hard-to-Drug Cancer Targets.",
    "abstract": "Innovation in drug development is an evolving concept that can take many forms, and is often confused with iteration, i.e., new versions of existing drug classes targeting familiar oncogenes. Yet meaningful innovation increasingly lies in translating approaches to historically 'untouchable' targets: transcription factors, tumor suppressors, and lineage-defining proteins, which have long resisted conventional pharmacological approaches. At the ESMO Targeted Anticancer Therapies (TAT) 2025 Congress, a growing body of early-phase trials has continued to test and refine this paradigm, showcasing first-in-human studies and novel modalities aimed at drugging long-deemed inaccessible sites. In this manuscript, we review key highlights from ESMO TAT and other pivotal drug development meetings and delve into targeting these so-called 'untouchable' targets. Organized by target class (KRAS, MYC, TP53, WNT) and modality (PROTACs, ADCs, bispecifics), we explore how translational frameworks, rational trial design, and platform-specific engineering are reshaping what is now clinically feasible in drug development. Finally, we present early-phase data from the most compelling trials and compounds and explore what remains to be achieved to move beyond proof-of-concept into clinically meaningful benefits for patients with cancer.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone widely used to manage diabetes and obesity, through its ability to regulate glucose homeostasis. Clinically relevant GLP-1 sequences form oligomeric states. Uncontrolled oligomer formation can drive fibril formation, posing challenges such as difficulty in controlling drug dosage, loss of activity, or toxicity, as the aggregates can be immunogenic and/or can form amyloids. Here, we used combined measurements of colloidal and conformational stability to characterise the intermolecular interactions underpinning the physical status of the GLP-1 7-37 amide (GLP-1am), at pharmaceutically relevant high concentrations. We focus on less explored conditions, around pH 5, mimicking the environment within native cellular secretory granules, where the hormone is also densely packed. Co-solutes allowed us to interfere with weak interactions affecting peptide self-association into soluble oligomers, and the conversion into aggregates and fibrils. We show that GLP-1am exists as soluble oligomers that assemble into nanosheets over the timescale of hours, in quiescent conditions. Aggregation proceeded via a nucleation-dependent mechanism, with its rate correlating to the magnitude of attractive intermolecular interactions. It was accelerated by ionic co-solutes, indicating a key role for screening of electrostatic interactions in modulating peptide-peptide attraction and assembly. The rate of aggregation was also pH-dependent, with rates being slower at pH 5 than pH 8. Notably, the addition of proline, as a co-solute, delayed the onset of GLP-1am aggregation in a pH-dependent manner. Thus, in quiescent conditions, GLP-1am forms discrete soluble oligomers capable of organising into ordered nanostructures rather than amyloid fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Early-stage spliceosome assembly is critical to constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. This process is orchestrated by serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins (SRSF1-SRSF12) and SR-related proteins U1-70K and U2AF1. SR proteins recognize exonic splicing enhancers and interact with U1-70K and U2AF1 to recruit the U1 and U2 snRNP complexes to the 5' and 3' splice sites, respectively. However, the molecular basis of the interaction between SR proteins and U2AF1 has remained poorly understood, largely due to the poor solubility of full-length U2AF1. Here, we successfully refold and solubilize U2AF1 and confirm its structural integrity. This enables investigation of its interaction with SRSF1, a prototypical SR protein. We show that the U2AF1 C-terminal RS domain (RS",

    "abstract": "Electromotility in mammalian outer hair cells (OHC) is the mechanism underlying cochlear amplification. It is brought about by the piezoelectric-like property of the membrane protein prestin (Slc26a5) that lies in the OHCs lateral plasma membrane. Prestin connects to an underlying cytoskeletal network of circumferential actin filaments that bridge longitudinal spectrin filaments. This network, in turn, lies between the plasma membrane and a closely apposed ER-like tubular array of subsurface cisternae (SSC). Two previous papers examining spectrin knockouts in embryonic hair cells were confined to analyzing the effects on the apical cuticular plate and overlying stereocilia. In this paper, we examine the effects of conditional knockouts of alpha2 spectrin in postnatal OHCs. We find a significant auditory phenotype likely due to the novel disassociation of prestin's gating charge movement from OHC electromotility. In addition, OHCs show enlargement in their SSC and plasma membrane-SSC space with preserved cuticular plates and overlying stereocilia, the latter contrasts with the findings in embryonic knockouts.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens have evolved complex strategies that exploit the unique intracellular niches of organelles to establish a favorable replication environment that promotes infection and associated diseases. Defining how pathogens remodel organelle structures and compositions to redirect their functions is a major goal in cell biology. Recent technological advancements now enable structural characterizations of remodeled organelles in exquisite detail, as well as quantitative mapping of relocalized protein constituents and suborganellar interacting proteins. We describe emerging advances in complementary approaches for spatially and temporally profiling organelle rearrangements dictated by pathogen infection, with a focus on state-of-the-art microscopy, quantitative proteomics, and the integration of computational developments during virus infection. We examine the organellar resolutions and subcellular scales of these methodologies and recent applications during viral infections. We discuss how existing biochemical and bioinformatic tools can be integrated for systems-level mapping of organelle remodeling dynamics to dissect structure-function relationships of rewired organelles induced by microbes.",

    "abstract": "In aged humans and mice, hypobranched glycogen aggregates, known as polyglucosan bodies (PGBs), accumulate in hippocampal astrocytes. While PGBs are linked to cognitive decline in neurological diseases, they remain largely unstudied in the context of typical aging. We show that PGBs arise in autophagy-dysregulated astrocytes in the aged hippocampus, with substantial variation among 32 inbred BXD mouse strains. Genetic mapping through quantitative trait locus analysis identified a major locus (Pgb1) that modulates hippocampal PGB burden. Extensive transcriptomic and proteomic datasets were produced for the aged hippocampus of the BXD family to investigate the mechanism by which the Pgb1 locus modulates PGB burden. We identified that Pgb1 contains allelic Smarcal1 and Usp37 variants and influences PGB burden through trans-regulation of mRNA and protein expression levels, including abundance of glycogen-mobilizing factor PYGB. Furthermore, comprehensive phenome-wide association scans, transcriptomic analyses, and direct behavioral testing demonstrated that cognition remains intact despite age-related PGB burden. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the hypersensitive response (HR) are recognized as cornerstones of plant immunity; however, the mechanistic synergy and the strategies pathogens employ to dismantle this alliance remain elusive. Here, we identify a virulence effector, PstCRT (calreticulin), from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), that suppresses host immune responses by disrupting ER stress-mediated HR. PstCRT directly targets the HR-like lesion-inducing protein (TaHRLI) in wheat and obstructs its ER translocation. Within the ER lumen, TaHRLI interacts with wheat calreticulin (TaCRT), triggering Ca\u00b2\u207a efflux and activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) to induce cell death and disease resistance. Pathogen-derived PstCRT structurally mimics TaCRT to sequester TaHRLI to the plasma membrane via competitive interaction, thereby effectively suppressing ER stress-induced HR initiation. Crucially, we found that CRT secretion represents a conserved virulence strategy across different rust genera. AlphaFold-guided engineering of TaHRLI in wheat generated the TaHRLI",

    "abstract": "Thorns are modified branches that have evolved independently multiple times as defenses against herbivores. We previously identified the TCP transcription factors THORN IDENTITY1 (TI1) and TI2 as key regulators of thorn development in Citrus; however, how these genes are regulated remains unclear. In this study, using comparative transcriptomics, we identified TI3, encoding a SHORT INTERNODES/STYLISH (SHI/STY) family transcription factor that is specifically expressed in thorns. We found that TI3 binds to a previously undefined CTAG core element in the promoters of TI1 and TI2, activating their expression to promote stem cell arrest in the thorn meristem. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of TI3 function converted thorns into branches. Conversely, the PEBP family protein CsCENTRORADIALIS (CsCEN) represses TI3 expression in the axillary meristem to maintain stem cell activity and promote branch development. Mutations in CsCEN resulted in branch-to-thorn conversions, whereas cscen ti3 double mutants exhibited the ti3 mutant phenotype, supporting the idea that CsCEN regulates TI3 expression. The thorn-specific expression pattern of TI3 homologs across three Rutaceae species suggests that TI3 might have a conserved role in thorn development. Thus, TI3 represents a new regulator of meristem identity, and manipulating its activity is a promising approach for breeding thornless cultivars.",

In the year 1800 Alessandro Volta invented the first battery based on the anatomy of the eel's biological batteries (electrocytes). In the same year Alexander von Humbolt purportedly observed the extraordinary spectacle of South American fishermen herding horses into a pool containing electric eels. His description of the ensuing battle was published in 1807, catapulting electric eels (and Humbolt) to world fame. Later, in 1838, Michael Faraday - the father of modern electrostatics - published an extensive investigation of electric eel discharges, sealing the case for biologically generated electricity and kicking off modern studies of physiology.

Using integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analyses, we identified a distinct TAM subset in CRC characterized by high expression of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1). In a macrophage-depleted murine CRC model established with clodronate (CL2MDP) liposomes and MC38 cells, macrophage depletion significantly inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by reduced SPP1 expression and increased infiltration of CD8\u207a T cells and type 1 cytotoxic T (Tc1) cells. Supplementation with recombinant SPP1 partially reversed these antitumor effects. Mechanistically, in vitro coculture experiments demonstrated that TAM-derived SPP1 suppressed CD8\u207a T cell differentiation into Tc1 cells through CD44-mediated signaling, resulting in decreased TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 production and impaired activation of the LCK-ZAP70-LAT signaling pathway. These effects were attenuated by SPP1 neutralization or CD44 inhibition. Collectively, these findings elucidated TAM-derived SPP1 as a key mediator of immune suppression in CRC and suggested that the TAM-SPP1 axis is a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that repeated mRNA vaccination enhances the breadth of neutralization against diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. However, the development of antibodies capable of neutralizing across the Coronavirinae subfamily is poorly understood. In this study, we analyze serum samples to determine their neutralization breadth and potency and identify their antigenic targets. Using a cohort of older individuals and healthcare workers, we track correlates of broad neutralizing responses, including fusion peptide (FP) antibody elicitation. We find that although broadly neutralizing responses are often a result of receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, a rare subset of donors produce FP-specific broadly neutralizing responses. Interestingly, FP-specific antibodies are not observed in COVID-naive individuals, irrespective of vaccination regimen; rather, they occur following natural infection or vaccine breakthrough. This study highlights which epitope targets underpin broadly neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses and suggests that existing vaccines are insufficient to promote the elicitation of FP-directed broadly neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that, despite overlapping phenotypic features with multiple sclerosis (MS), manifests with more severe clinical outcomes. The defining pathogenic driver of NMOSD is the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) autoantibody, which induces astrocytic injury via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). MS is predominantly managed with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2) to reduce relapse rates. However, these therapies are often ineffective or even detrimental in NMOSD. Our findings demonstrate that while IFN-\u03b2 mitigates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it exacerbates NMOSD-like astrocytopathy. Deleting IFNAR1 counteracts this effect by selectively enhancing astrocyte activation without altering other CNS cells. Subsequently, we characterized multiple MS therapeutics that paradoxically worsen NMOSD-like pathology, whereas agents promoting astrocytic activation confer protection. Collectively, we establish a framework for astrocyte-centered drug screening and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting astrocytes in NMOSD, connecting fundamental disease mechanisms to clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The lysosome is not only a degradative organelle but also an essential platform for signal transduction, such as with MTOR signaling. The reciprocal regulation between the lysosome and MTOR is central to macroautophagy/autophagy and metabolism. MTOR-mediated suppression of lysosomal acidification is important for lysosomal activity, autophagic flux, and cell survival. VASN is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose function is not fully understood. In the present study, we report that VASN is a TGFB-inducible protein and plays a crucial role in positively regulating lysosomal acidification. As a potential mechanism, we demonstrated that VASN localizes to the lysosome, interacts with lysosomal MTOR and STK11IP, and disrupts the binding of STK11IP to MTOR and the V-ATPase, which was recently reported to suppress lysosomal acidification. We found that VASN's function in modulating lysosomal activity is essential for optimal mitophagy induced by TGFB and terminal erythroid differentiation and is critical for the progression of mutant KRAS-driven lung cancer. Overall, our study identified VASN as a novel TGFB-inducible regulator of lysosomal function.",

    "abstract": "Bone metastasis is a devastating complication of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), critically impairing patient survival. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this aggressive process remain incompletely elucidated. To systematically investigate these mechanisms, we compared a highly bone-metastatic NSCLC subpopulation with its parental cells. Notably, we identified elevated expression of O-linked \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) in the metastatic subpopulation. We further demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation at the Ser199 site of the nuclear pore protein POM121 is markedly increased and drives NSCLC bone metastasis. Mechanistically, O-GlcNAcylation of POM121 attenuates its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21, thus antagonizing ubiquitination and stabilizing POM121. Accumulated POM121 enhances the nuclear import of the oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC. Nuclear c-MYC subsequently orchestrates transcriptional activation of downstream extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes. Collectively, we elucidate a previously unrecognized OGT-POM121-c-MYC-ECM axis that critically drives NSCLC bone metastasis. Crucially, clinical analysis reveals that high levels of OGT, POM121, and c-MYC positively correlate with adverse clinical outcomes. These findings establish the OGT-POM121-c-MYC-ECM axis as a potential diagnostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC bone metastasis.",

NANOG is essential for directing the epiblast-primitive endoderm (PrE) fate choice, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its repressive activity remain incompletely understood. Here we show that NANOG partners with TBX3 and the PRC2 complex to maintain embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity by silencing PrE genes through newly identified distal enhancers. Loss of Nanog reduces PRC2-mediated repression of Gata6, initiating its expression independently of TBX3. Subsequent TBX3 upregulation enables its association with GATA6, driving a feed-forward programme that activates Gata6, Gata4 and Sox17 and promotes PrE differentiation. Thus, NANOG suppresses PrE fate not only by direct repression but also by preventing TBX3 from switching partners. These findings define a Nanog-Tbx3-Gata6 regulatory axis that integrates enhancer control, chromatin regulation and transcription factor redeployment to couple ESC maintenance with lineage commitment.",

Using galectin, a universal carbohydrate-binding protein, we investigated how IDRs evolved and acquired their biological roles in vertebrates. Through extensive proteome-wide sequence analyses, we found that vertebrate galectin IDRs share overall amino acid compositions but differ significantly in their aromatic residue types. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and lipopolysaccharide micelle assays, we demonstrated that despite these differences, IDRs from various vertebrate galectins independently converged toward a similar function: mediating agglutination via phase separation. Our data suggest that the specific types of aromatic residues within these IDRs were established early in evolution and underwent independent expansions among different vertebrate lineages. Additionally, we identified a conserved short N-terminal motif critical for promoting galectin self-association, which likely served as an incipient sequence for subsequent IDR evolution. Contrary to previous peptide studies emphasizing aromatic residue specificity, our findings highlight the evolutionary preference for increasing motif repetition over residue-type optimization to achieve functional fitness.",

VGLL4 expression is downregulated in response to irradiation and DSS-induced colitis. Consistently, public datasets of human colitis show reduced VGLL4 expression. Loss of VGLL4 in the intestinal epithelium decreases Paneth cell numbers and AMPs production, and triggers gut microbiota dysbiosis, impairing intestinal regenerative capacity. Mechanistically, VGLL4 forms a complex with TEAD4 and ATOH1, stimulating GFI1 expression and promoting Paneth cell differentiation. Furthermore, VGLL4 forms a complex with TEAD4 and TCF4 to induce defensin expression, thereby maintaining microbiota composition.

Here, we revealed hierarchical assembly of PopZ into a filamentous condensate by integrating cryo-electron tomography, biochemistry, single-molecule techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. The PopZ helical domain drives filamentation and condensation, while the disordered region inhibits them. Phase-dependent conformational changes prevent interfilament contacts in the dilute phase and expose client-binding sites in the dense phase. Perturbing filament formation in vitro alters the dynamics of scaffold and client proteins and the condensate's wetting behavior. In cells, perturbing either filament formation or the ability of filaments to condense impairs PopZ function and leads to growth phenotypes. These findings establish a multiscale framework linking molecular interactions and condensate ultrastructure to cellular function.",

    "abstract": "Hallmarks of multicellular eukaryotic genome organization are chromosome territories, compartments, and loop-extrusion-mediated structures, including TADs. However, these have mainly been observed in model organisms, and most eukaryotes remain unexplored. Using Hi-C in the silkworm Bombyx mori we discover a novel chromatin folding structure, compartment S, which is \"secluded\" from the rest of the chromosome. This compartment exhibits loop extrusion features and a unique genetic and epigenetic landscape, and it localizes towards the periphery of chromosome territories. While euchromatin and heterochromatin display preferential compartmental contacts, S domains are remarkably devoid of contacts with other regions, including with other S domains. In polymer simulations, this contact pattern can only be explained by high loop extrusion activity within compartment S, combined with low extrusion elsewhere throughout the genome. This proposed targeting of loop extrusion is a novel phenomenon, not observed in vertebrate models, but we speculate may extend to more organisms, such as other insects. Overall, our study underscores how evolutionarily conserved mechanisms-compartmentalization and loop extrusion-can be repurposed to create new 3D genome architectures.",

    "abstract": "Seed germination is orchestrated by antagonistic gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signals converging on the master germination repressor RGL2. Here, we unveil a receptor-competition paradigm where ABA receptors (PYLs) stabilize RGL2, both through direct physical interaction and through functional sequestration of DWA1, the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ligase substrate adapter mediating RGL2 ubiquitination. GA receptors (GID1s) counteract this stabilization by competitively displacing PYLs from RGL2, leveraging their superior binding capacity to license DWA1-mediated degradation. Crucially, this competition is defined by the concentration of abscisic acid and gibberellin as they regulate PYL and GID1 expression. Genetic epistasis confirms that PYLs act upstream of DWA1, competing directly with GID1 at RGL2. This receptor-occupied switch converts environmental fluctuations into proteolytic decisions: transient stress imposes a reversible \"pause state\" through PYL dominance, while sustained GA biosynthesis permits germination via GID1-mediated degradation. Our work establishes direct receptor competition as a complementary layer to hormone crosstalk, providing a universal framework for signal-driven developmental transitions.",

Its deposition reflects cell-cycle-regulated assembly of M18BP1, HJURP, and PLK1 on a divalent MIS18\u03b1/\u03b2 scaffold. The localization determinants of this machinery remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that in human cells, artificial M18BP1 dimerization bypasses MIS18\u03b1/\u03b2, allowing the identification of at least four determinants of M18BP1 centromere localization. These include the SANTA domain, of which we report the first structure, as well as linear motifs in disordered neighboring regions, of which we characterize the interaction footprint on the CENP-A-associated 16-subunit constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN). Our observations imply that M18BP1, after dimerization, is necessary and sufficient for centromere localization. Its cell-cycle-dependent dimerization on MIS18\u03b1/\u03b2 promotes initial recognition of a multivalent centromeric assembly of old CENP-A and associated proteins, followed by cooption of PLK1 and HJURP and new CENP-A deposition. Our results shed new light on the determinants of centromere epigenetic inheritance in humans.",

While moderate salt stress is known to enhance fruit sweetness, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as a model, this study investigates how salt stress promotes fruit sugar accumulation. Root-derived abscisic acid (ABA) transport to fruit acts as the key signal under salt stress. Elevated fruit-ABA activates the kinase SlSnRK2.6, which phosphorylates the SlZHD8 transcription factor. This phosphorylation inhibits SlZHD8 function by reducing its protein stability and DNA-binding, thereby relieving its repression of SlSUS3 and SlSWEET12 to enhance fruit-sugar accumulation. Furthermore, the SlSnRK2.6-SlZHD8-SlSWEET12 module also regulates root-sugar accumulation and confers salt tolerance. Evolutionary analysis revealed a beneficial ZHD8 haplotype, whose reduced promoter-binding affinity promotes fruit-sugar accumulation under normal conditions and enhances salt tolerance. These findings explain how stress enhances quality and highlight the potential of key mutations of ZHD8, particularly the beneficial haplotype, for breeding tomatoes with improved sugar content and salt tolerance.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) comprises an array of subdomains, each defined by a characteristic structure and function. Although altered ER processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, it is unclear whether shifts in ER structure or dynamics underlie these functional changes. Here we establish ER structural and functional remodelling as a conserved feature of ageing across yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as the exemplar of metazoan ageing, we reveal striking age-related reductions in ER volume across diverse tissues and a morphological shift from rough sheets to tubular ER. This morphological transition corresponds with large-scale shifts in ER proteome composition from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism, a phenomenon conserved in mammalian tissues. We show that Atg8 and ULK1-dependent ER-phagy drives age-associated ER remodelling through tissue-specific factors, including the previously uncharacterized ER-phagy regulator TMEM-131 and the IRE-1-XBP-1 branch of the unfolded protein response. Providing support for a model where ER remodelling is adaptive, diverse lifespan-extending paradigms downscale and remodel ER morphology throughout life. Furthermore, mTOR-dependent lifespan extension in yeast and worms requires ER-phagy, indicating that ER remodelling is a proactive and protective response during ageing. These results reveal ER-phagy and ER dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal ageing and age-delaying interventions.",

Butyrate supplementation restores immune competence in germ-free bees, mirroring the protective effects of microbiota-colonized individuals. Butyrate orchestrates lipid metabolic reprogramming in the fat body by activating glycerolipid and arachidonic acid metabolism through activating the G-protein coupled receptor 41 while inhibiting histone deacetylases.

    "abstract": "Gut commensal microbiota can play an integral role in shaping insect reproduction, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we report that gut bacteria promote host reproduction in the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis by inducing ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-mediated degradation of the key transcription factor Longitudinals lacking-like (Total). Antibiotic-induced gut bacterial depletion impairs ovarian development and fertility. These reproductive defects can be reversed by nicotinic acid (NA) supplementation or recolonization with a potent NA provider, Enterobacter hormaechei. Gut bacteria-derived NA enhances coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis and mitochondrial energy production, thereby activating the UPS. Ubiquitinome analysis reveals that gut bacteria enhance Total ubiquitination and promote its degradation. Total overabundance in gut bacteria-depleted females leads to decapentaplegic (dpp) overexpression and impaired reproduction. Conversely, Total knockdown suppresses dpp expression, resulting in disrupted mature egg formation. Our results reveal a link between gut bacteria-derived metabolites and host protein homeostasis which determines host reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "Biocatalysis contributes significantly to the development of more sustainable synthetic pathways by using mild reaction conditions and water as a solvent. However, many relevant classes of compounds, including privileged groups in drug design, are not yet accessible via enzymatic pathways. In this context, the development of an enzymatic route to indazoles remains an unmet challenge. Here, we present a nitroreductase-triggered indazole formation, in which 2-nitrobenzylamine derivatives are converted to reactive nitrosobenzylamine intermediates that spontaneously cyclize and aromatize to indazoles. Two nitroreductases accept a series of 2-nitrobenzylamine derivatives with excellent conversions (up to >99\u00a0%). In the case of N-substituted nitrosobenzylamines, 2H-indazoles are formed, whereas other derivatives led to 1H-indazoles. The synthetic value of the nitroreductase-triggered indazole formation is further demonstrated by successful coupling with an imine reductase in a sequential cascade reaction on a 50\u2009mg scale. With this cascade, 2H-indazoles are accessible from cheap 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and primary amines, resulting in up to 85\u00a0% conversion and 68\u00a0% isolated yield.",

    "abstract": "The lytic-latent balance is a major viral persistence strategy and obstacle to curing viral diseases, yet its mechanisms remain poorly understood. Following lytic infection in non-neuronal cells, herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency specifically in neurons and is reactivated by stresses. Here we identify forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors that can strongly activate or repress replication of HSV-1 and other alphaherpesviruses, and show that neurons express activating Fox (e.g., Foxf) genes poorly but repressive Fox (Foxk) genes abundantly while non-neuronal or stressed neuronal cells exhibit higher expression of activating Fox genes. Remarkably, knockdown of Foxk1 or overexpression of activating Fox genes induces reactivation from latency in male mouse neuronal culture and in vivo. Of note, FOX proteins bind the viral genome globally and nonsequence-specifically and interact with epigenetic cofactors for gene regulation. FOXF1 interacts with CBP and P300 to acetylate and open viral chromatin. FOXK1 works with SIN3A, a cofactor of histone deacetylation, and MAX to suppress HSV-1 and antagonize activating FOX proteins. Therefore, the viral lytic-latent balance is controlled by the relative abundance of counteracting host transcription factors that recruit different epigenetic regulators to the viral genome.",

Through analysis of phased APOE alleles, we identify a 19\u2009bp deletion approximately 1.1\u2009kb distal to the APOE 3'UTR in a SPI1 microglial transcription factor binding site. The deletion is present in 60% of African American APOE-\u03b54 homozygotes and reduces Alzheimer's disease odds ratio relative to individuals without the deletion. The deletion also delays Alzheimer's disease onset in APOE-\u03b54/\u03b54 cases with local African ancestry at APOE. The All of Us dataset confirms reduced Alzheimer\u00b4s disease risk associated with the deletion and identifies additional variants between APOE and APOC1 that disentangle APOE-\u03b54 neurological and lipid-related phenotypes. Functional assays reveal that the 19\u2009bp deletion abolishes SPI1 repression at this region. Collectively, these findings describe a protective allele at APOE in African Americans that mediates APOC1 expression, reducing relative Alzheimer\u00b4s disease risk.",

However, SODIS is time consuming (6-48\u2009h of sunlight exposure) due to its strong dependence on UV photons, which account for only ~4% of the solar energy. Thus, it is desirable to capture additional energy from visible-light photons (~50% of the solar energy) to accelerate the slow kinetics. Here, we use phosphorene nanoflakes (PNs) and BiOI nanosheets (BS) as model materials to construct a heterojunction\u00a0photocatalyst, illustrating that simultaneously modulating the interfacial interaction and band alignment between the heterojunction components can achieve a dual optimization of the kinetic and thermodynamic constraints in photo-induced charge carriers, effectively enhancing the utilization of visible-spectrum energy for microbial inactivation. Notably, a subminute\u00a0photocatalytic water disinfection performance is demonstrated by the PNs/BS heterojunction, completely inactivating 7\u2009log of E. coli within 45\u2009s under real sunlight.

This phenomenon is attributed to a new mechanism referred to as dynamic plastic deformation delocalization, which opens a new design space for enhancing the mechanical performance of metallic materials. We demonstrate that the activation of this mechanism has a significant impact on fatigue properties, greatly enhancing fatigue strength when it occurs.",

Although none of the A(H5N1) strains transmit via the air, B3.13 viruses are detected at significantly higher levels compared to D1.1 strains. Here we show strong correlations between viral loads in nasal washes, airborne virus shedding, and transmissibility in ferrets, highlighting the value of these metrics for identifying zoonotic influenza viruses that may be adapting toward increased transmission potential.",

    "abstract": "Genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics offer complementary insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Leveraging UK Biobank data, we introduce the CardiOmicScore, a multitask deep learning framework, to learn disease-specific proteomic (ProScore) and metabolomic (MetScore) risk scores for the six most common CVDs by profiling 2920 proteins and 168 metabolites. Experiments demonstrate that ProScore and MetScore are strong sole CVD risk predictors (C-index range: 0.69-0.82 for ProScore and 0.64-0.74 for MetScore), and can significantly enhance risk prediction across CVDs up to 15 years prior to disease onset when combined with clinical data, increasing the C-index by 0.005-0.102. These findings suggest that incorporating multiomics profiling into clinical practice can improve personalized risk assessments at early stages. CardiOmicScore also identifies important CVD-related proteins and metabolites, which represent promising data-driven pathways, calling for further external validation, to develop novel biomarkers and targeted therapies, facilitating precision medicine for primary prevention of CVDs.",

    "abstract": "Various outdoor scenarios demand both temperature control and self-protection from environment, which are often contradictory from the optical perspective, thus inspiring many material designs on multispectral camouflage and radiative cooling performance. However, these methods on the basis of one-dimensional photonic crystals or meta-surfaces always rely on stringent fabrication and may result in strong angular dependence. Here, we demonstrate an aluminum-polyamide 66 metal-based polymer bilayer thin film through hierarchical design at both the molecular and microscale levels and scalable production, enabling camouflage in infrared (3-5 \u03bcm and 8-14 \u03bcm) and laser (10.6 \u03bcm) bands with efficient radiative cooling in the non-atmospheric window (5-8 \u03bcm and 14-20 \u03bcm) while possessing weak angular dependence between -60\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Furthermore, our films can be tailored with specific emissivity and color to balance camouflage and cooling across diverse environments. This work provides a scalable, low-cost radiative cooling polymer film, advancing practical solutions for multispectral camouflage.",

Traditionally formed through single-electron oxidation of overcrowded electron-rich alkenes or acid-mediated dehydration of diols, these species show high reactivity toward carbon-based nucleophiles. However, their reactivities with heteroatom nucleophiles like amines and water remain underexplored, largely due to difficulties in controlling oxidation and undesirable acid-base interactions. Here, we report that carbodication species, generated under mild electrochemical or photocatalytic conditions in the presence of heteroatom nucleophiles, display remarkable electrophilic reactivity toward primary amines and water. This enables an intermolecular umpolung [4\u2009+\u20091] cycloaddition, proceeding via a cis-olefin-bridged dicationic intermediate, energetically favored over its trans-isomer, yielding a class of thioxanthene-based dispirocycles with 2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole or 2,5-dihydrofuran central cores.

In this study, we sought to develop long-lasting materials capable of cellular uptake, akin to intracellular interaction hubs. We develop a delivery method to efficiently transplant stable micron-size peptide-based compartments into living cells. By loading coacervates with nanobodies and bioPROTACs, we demonstrate successful target sequestration of natively expressed GFP to our synthetic hubs, and function as bioreactors to selectively degrade GFP inside human cells.

Now, a unique neurosurgical window on the human brain allows for electrically mapping cortical connections at the hospital, but studies so far have relied on average signals, masking the dynamic nature of signal flow across brain regions\u00a0and vigilance states. To causally estimate signal\u00a0flow, we repeatedly probed cortico-limbic networks with short-lived electrical pulses over days and assessed the variable fate of each transmitted signal on a single-trial basis. In the resulting openly available dataset, we characterized signaling probabilities and directionality across thousands of local and long-range cortico-limbic connections over days. Challenging established views, we found that limbic structures send twice as many signals as they receive, in both wakefulness and sleep. Our findings provide a fundamental framework for causally interpreting signal flow in the brain and formulating therapeutic strategies for brain network disorders.",

Currently, irrigation consumes about 1.38 \u00d7 10\u2079 gigajoules per year, of which three-quarters are used by surface irrigation systems and one-quarter by pressurized systems. Six crops-wheat, rice, maize, cotton, sugarcane, and vegetables-account for 60% of the total irrigated area and energy use. A sustainable expansion of irrigation in rainfed areas would increase irrigation energy consumption by approximately 17%, mostly in the Global South. These findings highlight that the magnitude of irrigation energy demand depends on system type, pumping depth, and climatic aridity. This study links crop-specific irrigation energy costs with productivity gains, guiding integrated planning for sustainable, climate-resilient food production.",

Their formation requires REE enrichment during prolonged magma evolution, achieved by suppressing REE-rich mineral crystallization and promoting REE-enriched brine melt formation. Our experiments on the fractional crystallization of carbonatitic magmas indicate that pressure (emplacement depth) is the primary factor controlling REE enrichment. High-pressure (\u2009>0.3\u2009GPa) promotes early olivine crystallization, depleting silica and suppressing REE-rich apatite formation. Deep emplacement also delays aqueous fluid exsolution, thereby stabilizing brine melts that enhance phosphate dissolution and prevent REE dispersion into apatite. In contrast, low-pressure conditions (\u2009<0.3\u2009GPa) lead to exsolution of REE-poor hydrothermal fluids, dispersing REE into magmatic apatite and preventing the deposition of economically significant REE-carbonates in subsequent hydrothermal stages. Our pressure-dependent model highlights deep emplacement as crucial for passive REE enrichment in residual brine melts, driving large-scale mineralization through precipitation of burbankite and/or bastn\u00e4site.",

Emerging evidence suggests that dietary interventions, particularly time-restricted feeding (TRF), may help restore this flexibility. In this study, we demonstrate that feeding upregulates PRMT3 and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)-containing proteins via insulin-pAKT signaling, while fasting reduces their expression. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT3 attenuates diet-induced obesity (DIO) and enhances adipocyte glycolysis in male mice. Mechanistically, PRMT3 drives the expression of citrate transporter SLC25A1 during feeding through direct arginine methylation. A 16:8 TRF regimen normalizes PRMT3 and ADMA levels while suppressing SLC25A1 expression. Notably, PRMT3 inhibition recapitulates the metabolic benefits of 16:8\u00a0TRF and improves metabolic flexibility. Furthermore, adipocyte-specific deletion of Slc25a1 in male mice protects against DIO and enhances insulin sensitivity. Collectively, these findings identify PRMT3-mediated arginine methylation in vWAT as a nutrient-responsive regulatory axis that impairs metabolic flexibility in obesity, which is a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Electrical control of magnetism is critical for advancing both fundamental understanding and technological applications of magnetic systems. Although gate-voltage-induced carrier modulation enables tuning of magnetic properties, current-induced mechanisms offer more dynamic and versatile control. To date, such control has been investigated exclusively through spin exchange interactions between itinerant and localized electrons, leaving the role of orbital exchange interactions entirely unexplored. Here, we establish a theoretical framework for current-induced control of magnetism mediated by orbital exchange interactions, incorporating the full orbital degrees of freedom, including orbital angular momentum and orbital angular position. We show that nonequilibrium orbital densities generated by the orbital Hall and orbital Edelstein effects induce not only damping-like and field-like torques, but also current-driven modifications of the magnetic anisotropy, damping, and gyromagnetic ratio. Our estimates suggest that orbital-exchange-mediated effects can exceed their spin-exchange counterparts, positioning orbital exchange as a dominant mechanism for magnetism control. We further propose experimental schemes based on harmonic Hall and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements to quantify these effects. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized route for electrical control of magnetism and extend current-induced effects to a broader class of materials beyond conventional dipolar magnets.",

By dechlorinating the poly(vinyl chloride), we harness its unique ability to convert sunlight into the energy required to break C-C bonds in polyolefins. This protocol allows for the transformation of low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, and polypropylene into waxes enriched with terminal olefins. Furthermore, it can also enable the conversion of polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(\u03b1-methyl styrene), styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene into their respective monomers. This broad applicability makes our protocol suitable for recycling of a wide range of post-consumer plastics and their mixtures under ambient environment.

While post-translational modifications regulate mitochondrial enzymes, their roles remain less explored compared to those in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Here, we demonstrate that reversible arginine methylation governs the activity of several mitochondrial enzymes, with a particular focus on isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2). We identify coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) as a mitochondrial enzyme that asymmetrically dimethylates IDH2 at R188, leading to enzymatic inhibition while enhancing protein stability. This modification is dynamically reversed by the lysine demethylases KDM3A and KDM4A, which restore IDH2 activity. Notably, despite its reduced stability, demethylated IDH2 promotes \u03b1-ketoglutarate production, enhancing mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption. These findings highlight the critical role of reversible arginine methylation in fine-tuning mitochondrial enzyme function and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.",

In this study, we demonstrated that the conditional knockout of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) subunits Eif2s1 and Eif2s2 in mouse oocytes caused oocyte apoptosis within the early growing follicles. Subsequent research indicated that the depletion of Eif2s2 in oocytes reduced the levels of mitochondrial fission-related proteins (p-DRP1, FIS1 and MFF) and increased the mRNA and protein levels of the integrated stress response (ISR)-related factors (ASNS, SLC7A1, GRB10 and PSAT1). Consistent with this, the depletion of Eif2s2 in oocytes resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by elongated form, aggregated distribution beneath the oocyte membrane, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, and excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the same time, the depletion of Eif2s2 in oocytes led to increased levels of DNA damage response proteins (\u03b3H2AX, p-CHK2 and p53) and proapoptotic proteins (BAX and PARP1), as well as decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. Collectively, these findings indicate that the depletion of eIF2 subunits in mouse oocytes leads to oocyte apoptosis within the early growing follicles, attributed to the impaired translation of mitochondrial dynamics regulatory proteins and then the upregulated ROS levels and DNA damage.

BT consists of two coupled Josephson Junctions (JJ) in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. At the heart of the BT operation is a new mechanism for phase-locking the Bloch oscillations in JJs to microwaves via induced charge. The charge phase locking allows not only quantization of current but also gate voltage control of this quantization through the Aharonov-Casher effect.

    "title": "A MIF-p38-GSDMD inflammatory loop in keratinocytes underlies UVB-induced cutaneous lupus.",
    "abstract": "Ultraviolet B (UVB) is a well-recognized trigger of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), yet its molecular basis remains largely undefined. Here, using single-cell transcriptomics and a lupus-prone mouse model, we identify keratinocyte-derived macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as a key amplifier of cutaneous inflammation through a self-sustaining feedback loop. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals elevated MIF expression specifically within pathogenic, interferon-high keratinocyte subclusters associated with CLE, which is further validated across major CLE subtypes in clinical skin samples. In vitro, UVB irradiation dose-dependently induces the release of MIF from keratinocytes, which in turn promotes inflammatory signaling and matrix remodeling in both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that UVB irradiation activates the ribotoxic stress response (RSR), leading to the p38-C/EBP\u03b2-mediated transcriptional upregulation of NLRP3 and GSDMD cleavage in keratinocytes. The ensuing GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis facilitates the release of MIF, primarily through GSDMD pores rather than vesicular secretion, which in turn amplifies the p38-C/EBP\u03b2 signaling pathway. Therapeutic disruption of this loop either by gene silencing via AAVs or pharmacological inhibition via microneedles, markedly attenuates epidermal hyperplasia and cytokine imbalance in lupus-prone mice. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized MIF-p38-GSDMD inflammatory loop contributes to the UVB-induced cutaneous lupus, offering both mechanistic insights and translational opportunities for CLE.",

    "title": "Transglutaminase 2 exacerbates ovarian cancer survival by directly inactivating GSK3\u03b2.",
    "abstract": "Elevated expression of transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2, EC 2.3.2.13, protein-glutamine \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, gene name TGM2) is known as one of the most upregulated genes during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian cancer. Despite initial complete responses to conventional chemotherapy, ovarian cancer often recurs with metastasis, presenting a significant clinical challenge. Drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells exhibit markedly higher levels of TGase 2 compared to normal ovarian epithelium, which is associated with EMT activation, enabling them to evade chemotherapy effects. Intracellular TGase 2 is recognized as a key factor in maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype. Therefore, while EMT expression can be effectively reversed by inhibiting TGase 2, the underlying mechanism of this effect remains unclear. We found that TGase 2 promotes EMT by directly binding to glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), promoting the stabilization of \u03b2-catenin. Domain mapping revealed that the N-terminus of TGase 2 interacts with the mid-region of GSK3\u03b2, leading to the autophagic degradation of GSK3\u03b2. Pharmacological disruption of this N-terminal interaction by streptonigrin, in combination with standard chemotherapy, extended overall survival in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. This study identified TGase 2 as a pivotal regulator of EMT-driven metastasis and drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Enolase 1 (ENO1) is a glycolytic enzyme involved in tumor progression that performs a variety of classical and nonclassical functions. However, the mechanism by which it promotes tumor progression is still not fully understood. Here, we revealed that TGF\u03b21/Smad3 signaling triggered the symmetric dimethylation of arginine (SDMA) on ENO1 by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), leading to membranous ENO1 translocation. Surface ENO1 interacts with monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) for lactate secretion, which recruits M2 macrophages and promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeting surface ENO1 with HuL001, a first-in-class humanized antibody, significantly reduced glycolysis, decreased extracellular lactate accumulation, reprogrammed macrophage polarization and inhibited tumor growth and distant metastasis. Moreover, targeting surface ENO1 significantly increased the therapeutic response to radiotherapy and delayed tumor regrowth by increasing antitumoral M1 macrophages and cytotoxic CD8",

    "abstract": "In a 6-month pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT; ISRCTN16033549), we compared a just-in-time intervention to support energy management in adults with long COVID (LC) to standard care. Participants received either the 'Pace Me' app and a wearable activity tracker (intervention) or an app only with data entry screens (control). The intervention group received just-in-time messages on energy management when they reached 50%, 75%, and 100% of their daily 'activity allowance'. The primary outcome was post-exertional malaise (PEM) measured by the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire-PEM (DSQ-PEM). Of 369 participants assessed for eligibility, 250 participants were randomised 1:1, and 77 controls and 84 intervention participants were included in the final per-protocol analysis. There was no time by group interaction for the DSQ-PEM. The intervention group value was 48 (95% CI 44-53) at baseline and 46 (95% CI 41-51) post-intervention (arbitrary units). The control group value was 47 (95% CI 42-52) at baseline and 44 (95% CI 39-49) at follow-up (interaction effect p\u2009=\u20090.614, \u03b7\u00b2p\u2009=\u20090.002; trivial). No individual question exhibited an interaction effect (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Although the intervention had minimal effect compared to control, the substantial recovery rates previously reported in LC, coupled with our wide inclusion criteria may have masked intervention effects. Therefore, future studies should consider this energy management framework in conditions without such recovery rates, such as CFS.",

    "abstract": "Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an age-related disorder characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and loss of corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs), eventually leading to corneal blindness. Despite known environmental and genetic contributors, the roles of aging and hormonal influences, particularly in the predominantly female population, remain underexplored in FECD. This study investigates the impact of chronic exposure to combined ultra-violet (UV-A) light and the oxidized estrogen metabolite 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2) on healthy CEnCs, primarily focusing on the cellular senescence pathway implicated in FECD pathogenesis. Our results show that prolonged exposure triggers G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through the p16-pRB pathway, inducing a senescence-mediated pro-secretory phenotype. The senescent cells in G0/G1 phase concurrently upregulated the fibrotic and extracellular matrix (ECM) markers indicating a complex relationship between senescence with fibrosis and ECM deposition. Additionally, multiplex analysis to detect senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) after chronic exposure revealed significant upregulation of pathogenic factors such as IL-8 and IL-17, which were attenuated by SB225002 (anti-CXCR2) and secukinumab (anti-IL-17A). Senolytic cocktail of Dasatinib and Quercetin treatment alleviated fibrosis by selectively eliminating senescent cells and improved the survival of healthy cells. This study introduces a novel in vitro model of FECD, revealing the crucial role of cell cycle modulation, senescence and interleukins in the disease advancement and pathogenesis. The findings suggest that targeting senescence and cytokine-driven inflammation could be a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating FECD progression.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we showed that adult human olfaction retains plasticity in the unilateral processing of molecular chirality (Feng and Zhou, 2019). Using a similar unilateral discrimination protocol across three experiments with human adults (n = 96; 1,295 sessions), we now reveal distinct patterns of specificity, generalization, and persistence in olfactory learning, independent of adaptation or task difficulty. Training with binary odor mixtures at varying ratios consistently produced durable gains that transferred across nostrils and generalized to novel mixtures differing in both structure and perceptual quality. Conversely, training with odor enantiomers or concentration differences yielded neither transfer nor generalization, and concentration discrimination learning was short-lived. These results indicate that mixture configural quality is a distinct olfactory attribute from chirality or relative concentration, and that discrimination learning engages plasticity at different stages of olfactory processing depending on the task-relevant attribute. Moreover, they identify mixture discrimination training as a promising strategy for rehabilitating smell loss and cultivating olfactory expertise.",

    "title": "Interaction between HIV-1 Tat and EBV Zta favours immune escape of B cells by downregulating HLA-ABC expression.",
    "abstract": "Both Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) are associated with an increased risk of malignancies. HIV infection is associated with EBV reactivation and an increase in EBV viral loads in saliva and blood, and people living with HIV frequently develop EBV-associated B-cell malignancies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of HIV-1 and EBV co-existence in the development of B-cell malignancies. To do so, we focused our attention on the two viral transcriptional activators (HIV-1 Tat and EBV Zta) and analyzed their possible interaction since they both have cell-penetration domains and can be found simultaneously in the blood or cells of people living with HIV. We investigated the interaction of Tat and Zta using co-immunoprecipitation, in vitro binding, YFP reconstitution assay and FRET. We found that they bind each other in human B cells and blood serum. Tat and Zta interaction was also observed in a serum sample from one HIV-positive individual. YFP reconstitution demonstrated that this interaction occurred predominantly in the nucleus, indicating that it might affect the host genome. We further analyzed the effects of Tat and Zta on primary and EBV-transformed human B cells by RNA-sequencing and found that the combined Tat and Zta action in B cells differed from a single action of the two proteins. A subset of genes, activated by Tat or Zta alone, that trigger an immune response and antigen presentation in B cells, remained unchanged when the two proteins were combined. B cells, treated or transfected with Tat and Zta, exhibited a substantial decrease in HLA-ABC (MHC class I) expression, a critical component of the antigen processing and presentation pathway. Our findings suggest that the reduction of total HLA-ABC levels in B cells upon Tat and Zta interaction might be linked to HLA-ABC proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, HLA-ABC downregulation induced by Tat and Zta interaction conferred protection against cytotoxic T cell recognition of EBV-infected B cells. To conclude, we demonstrated for the first time that HIV-1 Tat and EBV Zta interacted directly in B cells and blood serum; this interaction can be found in people with HIV. This interaction brings about immune evasion of EBV-infected or transformed B cells.",

We examined the diminishing returns among Black and White individuals across cancer types using a nationally representative study population.\nThe study analyzed cancer-specific survival among 5.3 million non-Hispanic Black and White adults diagnosed with primary cancer (2006-2020) using SEER-22. We assessed how race and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) jointly affects survival across 21 cancer types. A 10-level race-SES variable was created, using White individuals in the highest-SES group as the reference. The main outcome was cancer-specific death. Diminishing returns were defined quantitively and qualitatively as worse survival for Black individuals even at higher SES. Cox models adjusted for demographics and clinical factors, with multiple imputation for missing data. Social gradients were also evaluated.\nBlack women showed strong evidence of diminishing returns overall and for seven cancers, especially uterine and breast cancers. A social gradient was also evident in cancers with diminishing returns, except uterine cancer. For Black men, diminishing returns were not observed across all cancers combined but was present in eight cancers-including prostate and colorectal cancers. Most cancers among men exhibited a strong social gradient. Findings were consistent by time period and upon restricting to localized and regional disease in sensitivity analyses.\nHigher SES improves cancer survival for White patients but not Black patients, worsening racial disparities for certain cancers.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is a critical challenge in treating life-threatening fungal infections. Here, we uncover a mechanism of acquired azole resistance in Candida albicans through mutations in CAP1, encoding a conserved fungal transcription factor that mediates the oxidative stress response. We analyzed 300 clinical isolates and identified 25 distinct CAP1 missense or nonsense mutations, with many occurring within the DNA-binding domain. We identified two nearly identical CAP1 heterozygous nonsense mutations, one in an isolate obtained from a bloodstream infection and one in a population of cells undergoing adaptation to fluconazole in vitro. Both CAP1 nonsense mutations resulted in loss of the C-terminal nuclear export signal, leading to nuclear retention of Cap1 and subsequent activation of genes associated with the oxidative stress response and drug transport. The CAP1 C-terminal truncations conferred significant fitness advantages in the presence of fluconazole, both in vitro and in a murine model of candidiasis. Strikingly, we discovered a therapeutic vulnerability: azole concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration were fungicidal to mutants with the CAP1 C-terminal truncation. The fungicidal effect was attributed to both elevated azole-induced reactive oxygen species and a compromised oxidative stress response in Cap1-truncated cells. Our results provide novel characterization of de novo CAP1 point mutations emerging in both laboratory and clinical contexts, elucidate the mechanisms underlying Cap1-regulated stress responses, and reveal a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in C. albicans infections.",

    "abstract": "Long term laboratory-based evolution experiments are a powerful tool that are increasingly being used to study fundamental aspects of evolution and to identify genes that contribute to overall fitness under different conditions. However, even with automation, the time that they take to execute limits the extent to which evolution experiments can be used as part of a high throughput approach to understand the links between genotype and phenotype. Mutations that lead to genetic loss of function (LoF) are frequently selected for in evolution experiments. Thus, in principle these experiments could be done more rapidly by starting not with clonal isolates but with dense transposon libraries that will contain loss of function mutations in all non-essential genes. Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing the results of long term (5 month) evolution experiment, in which E. coli was grown with daily transfers in unbuffered LB starting at pH 4.5, with short term (5 and 10 day) experiments on a high-density transposon library in the same strain and under the same conditions. We show that there is a overlap in the genes and pathways identified using the two methods, as well as identifying other gene of interest whose LoF contributes to fitness. This approach has the potential to complement laboratory-based evolution, enabling rapid, higher throughput, testing of a wide range of parameters that may have an influence on evolutionary trajectories.",

    "title": "The regenerative period of somatosensory nerves is closed by a DCC signaling axis.",
    "abstract": "Tissues and organs have periods of plasticity that close with age. While period closures can lock in tissue architecture and prevent aberrant cellular interactions, they also limit regenerative capacity. These regenerative periods - a timeframe with regeneration capacity - are defined, but the underlying genetic mechanisms that close specific regenerative periods remains critical knowledge that needs expanding. Here, we established zebrafish larvae as a model to study the genetic basis of regenerative period closure. We demonstrated that laser axotomy of the centrally-projecting axons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons exhibit a robust regenerative period that is closed by 3 days post fertilization (dpf). The closure of the regenerative period corresponds with the rearrangement of glia that express netrin, introducing the idea that changes in the DCC-mediated signaling axis could be a genetic and molecular basis closing the regenerative period. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated dcc, cAMP, and Rac1 in transgenic animals that label axons and the actin cytoskeleton. Combined with genetic epistasis analysis, we show that altering DCC signaling can re-open the regenerative period, allowing severed axons to regrow into the spinal cord. We show that this increased capacity to reinvade the spinal cord is mediated by growth cone invadopodia. Using calcium reporters and behavioral analysis, we demonstrate that re-opening the regenerative period by manipulating the DCC signaling axis restores the sensory circuit and sensory-specific behaviors. By introducing this genetic basis for regenerative period closure, these results reveal an active suppression process that keeps regenerative periods closed and establishes a new model for future dissection of such periods.",

    "abstract": "Hijacking of host DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways to facilitate virus replication is broadly conserved amongst diverse viral families. It has been well established that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr induces constitutive DDR signaling and G2/M cell cycle arrest, but the virologic function of this activity remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of functional, pharmacologic, biochemical, and genetic approaches to establish that virion-associated and de novo Vpr proteins induce DDR responses that trigger global epigenetic remodeling and activation of transcription programs to enhance HIV-1 promoter activity during acute infection and reactivation from latency. Functional, genetic, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments reveal that Vpr segregates into two functionally discrete pools-a multimeric pool in the nucleus associated with chromatin and a monomeric pool in the cytoplasm associated with a host E3-ubiquitin ligase. Vpr-induced DDR and epigenetic remodeling activities are present in common HIV-1 subtypes circulating globally and in patient-derived isolates.",

Nevertheless, the research on the neural conduction mechanism of oviposition is still rather limited in most agricultural pests. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved Kainate receptors (KARs) expressed in the glutamatergic neurons (GNs) and the ovipositor neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) regulate the oviposition behavior in Bactrocera dorsalis. We identified two KARs (Grik2b and Grik2c), which control the oviposition behavior by influencing both oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Protein-ligand interaction indicated that glutamate serves as the neurotransmitter of Grik2b and Grik2c. Knockdown glutamate-coding genes adversely impacted oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Specific knockdown Grik2b (or Grik2c) in the GNs and NMJs could respectively influence oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Finally, inhibitors of KARs were screened for their ability to inhibit oviposition. Our study provides strong supporting evidence that a novel neural conduction mechanism for oviposition by uncovering the diverse roles of KARs and provides potential molecular target controlling insect oviposition.",

    "abstract": "The clinically significant pathogen Clostridioides difficile lacks the transmembrane nutrient germinant receptors conserved in almost all spore-forming bacteria. Instead, C. difficile initiates spore germination using a unique mechanism that requires two signals: a bile acid germinant and a co-germinant, which can be either an amino acid or a divalent cation. While two soluble pseudoproteases, CspC and CspA, were initially identified as the germinant and co-germinant receptors, respectively, in C. difficile, we previously identified residues in an unstructured region of CspC that regulate the sensitivity of C. difficile spores to both signals. However, the mechanism by which CspC transduces these signals remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CspC forms a stable complex with CspA and determine the crystal structure of the CspC:CspA heterodimer. The structure reveals extensive interactions along the binding interface, including direct interactions between the unstructured region of CspC and CspA. Using structure-function analyses, we identify CspC:CspA interactions that regulate the sensitivity of C. difficile spores to germinant signals and show that CspA regulates the response of C. difficile to not only co-germinant but also germinant signals. While we show that CspA can form a homodimer and determine its crystal structure, CspA homodimerization appears unimportant for C. difficile spore germination. Collectively, our analyses establish the CspC:CspA heterodimer, rather than its individual constituents, as a critical signaling node for sensing both germinant and co-germinant signals. They also suggest a new mechanistic model for how C. difficile transduces germinant signals, which could guide the development of therapeutics against this important pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat emerging through microbe adaptation, driven by genetic variation, genome plasticity or epigenetic processes. In this study, we investigated how the Mucor circinelloides species complex adapts to the antifungal natural product FK506, which binds to FKBP12 and inhibits calcineurin-dependent hyphal growth. In Mucor bainieri, most FK506-resistant isolates (90%) were found to be unstable and transient, readily reverting to being drug sensitive when passaged without drug, and with no associated DNA mutations. In half of the isolates (50%), FK506-resistance was conferred by RNAi-dependent epimutation in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silenced the fkbA encoding FKBP12 post-transcriptionally. In contrast, most of the remaining FK506-resistant isolates (40%) were found to have undergone heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 dimethylation, transcriptionally repressing fkbA and neighboring genes. In these heterochromatic epimutants, only minimal enrichment of siRNA to the fkbA locus was observed, but in three of the four examples, siRNA was significantly enriched at a locus distant from fkbA. A similar mechanism operates in Mucor atramentarius, where FK506 resistance was mediated by ectopic heterochromatin silencing of fkbA and associated genes with siRNA spreading across the region. Heterochromatin-mediated fkbA epimutants exhibited stability during in vivo infection, suggesting epimutation could impact pathogenesis. These findings reveal that antifungal resistance arising through distinct, transient epimutation pathways involving RNAi or heterochromatin, highlighting adaptive AMR strategies employed by ubiquitous eukaryotic microbes.",

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CALF), the major stromal component, exist as heterogeneous populations with both tumor-promoting and tumor-restraining functions. In this issue of Cancer Research, Manoukian and colleagues uncover a previously unrecognized hormonal axis in PDAC, demonstrating that estrogen signaling reprograms fibroblast identity and shapes the tumor microenvironment. Building on prior work identifying an inflammatory CALF subset marked by high OGN and CLEC3B expression (iCAF.1) and associated with favorable prognosis, the authors show that estrogen produced by cancer cells promotes this tumor-restraining phenotype while limiting myofibroblastic CALF activation. Reciprocally, CALF-derived branched-chain amino acids taken up by cancer cells via SLC25A44-mediated uptake fuel estrogen biosynthesis, creating a feedback loop that sustains the classical, less aggressive PDAC subtype. Collectively, these findings establish estrogen as a key modulator of CALF heterogeneity and highlight a novel mechanism of tumor-stroma cross-talk with potential therapeutic implications for stroma-directed interventions in pancreatic cancer.

In the K-ROAD cohort (N\u2009=\u20091,263), the dominant prognostic contributors varied by clinical context-GFAP in cognitively unimpaired individuals, hippocampal volume in mild cognitive impairment, and age in dementia-while plasma phosphorylated tau-217 provided consistent secondary prognostic information across stages. Outcome-specific staging captured clinically meaningful gradients of progression risk and informed construction of a unified six-stage framework (Stage 0-IVB) with distinct inflection points of accelerated decline. External validation in the ADNI cohort (N\u2009=\u2009290) demonstrated consistent patterns of worsening prognosis, particularly in early and intermediate stages.

    "abstract": "To segregate chromosomes at cell division, the spindle must maintain its structure under force. How it does so remains poorly understood. To address this question, we use microneedle manipulation to apply local force to spindle microtubule bundles, kinetochore fibers (k-fibers), inside mammalian cells. We show that local load directly fractures k-fibers and that newly created plus-ends often have arrested dynamics, resisting depolymerization. Force alone, without fracture, is sufficient for spindle microtubule stabilization, as revealed by laser ablating k-fibers under local needle force. Doublecortin, which binds a compacted microtubule lattice, is lost around the force application site, suggesting local force-induced structural remodeling. In turn, end-binding protein 1 (EB1), which recognizes guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-tubulin, is locally enriched at stabilization sites, both before and after force-induced fracture. Together, our findings support a model in which force-induced damage leads to local spindle microtubule lattice remodeling and stabilization, which we propose reinforces the spindle where it experiences critical loads.",

Using spectral decomposition of fMRI responses during naturalistic movie viewing, we find that idiosyncratic neural patterns persist across multiple orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. Remarkably, each dimensional range encodes qualitatively distinct aspects of individual processing, and this multidimensional neural geometry predicts subsequent behavioral differences in memory recall, including variation in the concreteness versus abstractness of narrative descriptions. These fine-grained patterns of inter-individual variability cannot be reduced to those detected by conventional intersubject correlation measures.

We found that Caenorhabditis elegans CKS-1 and its partner CDK-1 co-localized to the cytosol, chromosomes, and spindle structures throughout cell division. Nevertheless, CKS-1 was required well after CDK-1, during oocyte meiosis I metaphase, which was prolonged in cks-1 mutants. Anaphase A precedes anaphase B in C. elegans oocytes, and while delayed in onset, chromosomes in cks-1 mutants separated normally during meiosis I anaphase A but failed to separate further and instead rapidly transitioned into meiosis II prometaphase, skipping anaphase B. The anaphase A to B transition also was defective during meiosis II. Furthermore, meiosis I anaphase B required that CKS-1 be bound to CDK-1 and have a functional anion pocket. Finally, our results suggest that CKS-1 promotes anaphase onset during meiosis I through securin destruction and during meiosis II through cycling B1 destruction, and that both securin and cycling B3 have positive roles independent of their destruction during meiosis II.",

    "abstract": "Nervous systems rely on sensory feature maps, where the tuning of neighboring neurons for some ethologically relevant parameter varies systematically, to control behavior. Such maps can be organized topographically or based on some computational principle. However, it is unclear how the central organization of a sensory system corresponds to the functional logic of the motor system. This problem is exemplified by insect flight, where sub-millisecond modifications in wing-steering muscle activity are necessary for stability and maneuverability. Although the muscles that control wing motion are anatomically and functionally stratified into distinct motor modules, comparatively little is known about the architecture of the sensory circuits that regulate their precise firing times. Here, we leverage an existing electron microscopy volume of an adult female ventral nerve cord (VNC) of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to reconstruct the complete population of afferents in the haltere-nature's only biological \"gyroscope\"-and their synaptic partners. We morphometrically classify these neurons into distinct subtypes and design split-GAL4 lines that help us determine the peripheral locations from which each subtype originates. We find that each subtype, rather than originating from the same anatomical location, comprises multiple regions on the haltere. We then trace the flow of rapid mechanosensory feedback from the peripheral haltere receptors to the central motor circuits that control wing kinematics. Our work demonstrates how a sensory system's connectivity patterns construct a neural map that may facilitate rapid processing by the motor system.",

Despite the prevalence and diversity of these lichen cohabitants, their geographic distribution and role within the lichen consortium remain poorly understood. Combining genomics, metagenomics, and advanced microscopy, we identified the black fungus Melanina gundecimermaniae as a constant cohabitant in the lichen Umbilicaria pustulata. We analyzed metagenomes from 149 individuals across 15 populations, spanning the Europe-wide range of U. pustulata. Additionally, we screened pooled metagenomes of U. pustulata and Umbilicaria phaea along five elevation gradients (Europe and North America). Genome mapping, using a near-complete reference genome of M. gundecimermaniae, revealed that the black fungus was present in 100% of the screened lichen metagenomes, with 0.85%-3.78% of reads mapping against the reference. Among all lichen-associated fungi, it was one of the most common. These findings indicate that the black fungus is widely distributed and associated with different lichen species, underscoring its potential ecological significance. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy, we confirmed the presence of M. gundecimermaniae within various structures of U. pustulata, including vegetative symbiotic propagules involved in dispersal. Elucidating its widespread occurrence across continents, consistent presence in U. pustulata, and ability to be dispersed together with the lichens' canonical partners, our findings suggest a potential interaction of M. gundecimermaniae that extends beyond incidental colonization. Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence that organismal complexity within lichens is a prevalent and largely unexplored dimension of the lichen symbiosis.",

    "title": "Individual identification of brown bears using pose-aware metric learning.",
    "abstract": "Identifying individuals within a species is a cornerstone of ecological and biological research, holding the key to understanding behavior, population dynamics, and conservation needs. However, conventional identification methods such as genetic sampling and physical tags come with significant trade-offs, including invasiveness, high costs, and limited scalability. Despite remarkable advances in computer vision that have transformed the identification of patterned species, reliably distinguishing individuals in unmarked species remains an open challenge. Here, we curate a novel dataset of visually identified individual Alaskan coastal brown bears (Ursus arctos). This 72,940-image dataset contains high-resolution images of 109 known individuals from multiple seasons and in varied conditions (e.g., fur shedding, substantial weight gain). Identification of these bears is notoriously difficult, yet our new pose-aware metric-learning-based AI model is able to leverage biometric information that enables individual re-identification (ReID) with promising accuracy for future research and conservation efforts. Our findings indicate that it is possible to reidentify individual brown bears across years and to detect unknown individuals in a \"real-world\" open dataset. PoseSwin presents a promising approach to the challenge of non-invasive ReID of other unmarked species, as well, and points toward an expanded range of possible questions in wildlife and ecological research.",

    "title": "Bacterial metabolites induce cell wall remodeling, antifungal resistance, and immune recognition of commensal fungi.",
    "abstract": "The fungus Candida albicans commensally colonizes mucosal surfaces in healthy individuals but can cause both superficial mucosal and life-threatening disseminated infections. The balance between commensalism and pathogenicity is complex and depends on factors including host and fungal genetic background, the host environment, and fungal interactions with local microbes. The major interaction interface of C. albicans with the host is its multilayered cell wall, which is dynamic and highly responsive to the surrounding environment. Therefore, factors that influence the fungal cell wall will directly impact C. albicans-host interactions. Our work demonstrates that multiple physiologically relevant gastrointestinal bacteria influence fungal cell wall composition during co-culture with C. albicans, including as complex communities derived from the gut. Using Escherichia coli as a model, we show that bacterial-induced fungal cell wall remodeling occurs rapidly and is mediated by secreted bacterial metabolite(s). Fungal mutant analysis revealed that the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is critical for responding to environmental stresses, has an important role in regulating this cell wall remodeling phenotype through the Sln1 histidine kinase. Importantly, bacterial-mediated fungal cell wall remodeling increases C. albicans resistance to the echinocandins, increases macrophage phagocytic rates, and decreases recognition by human immunoglobulin A (IgA). Overall, this work comprehensively characterizes an interaction between C. albicans and common gastrointestinal bacteria that has important implications for fungal biology and host interactions.",

    "title": "Loss and gain of motor protein function cause microtubule bundle damage in Drosophila axons.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration often starts by atrophy of the cable-like nerve fibers (axons) that wire nervous systems. Maintaining axons requires supply via motor-protein-driven transport along uninterrupted bundles of microtubules. Functional loss of motor proteins, but surprisingly also their hyperactivation, links to conditions of axonal atrophy; in both cases the underlying mechanisms are little understood. To bridge this important knowledge gap, we carried out systematic studies using 40 different genetic tools to manipulate 19 context-related genes in one standardized Drosophila primary neuron system. Starting with transport motors, we found that downregulation in at least three of them-dynein heavy chain, the kinesin family member 5 (KIF5) ortholog kinesin heavy chain (Khc), and KIF1A ortholog Unc-104-caused disintegration of axonal microtubule bundles, which we refer to as \"microtubule-curling\"; this damages the essential highways for life-sustaining axonal transport. To understand this phenomenon, we focused on Khc's various subfunctions. We found that abolishing Khc-mediated mitochondrial and lysosomal transport affects the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn triggers microtubule-curling in fly and mouse neurons alike. Taking the opposite approach by using conditions where Khc is hyperactive, we observed comparable microtubule-curling, triggered by an ROS-independent mechanism likely involving excessive mechanical force generation. To assess wider relevance of our findings, we studied Unc-104, its binding partner KIF-binding protein (KIFBP), and human KIF5A. These studies suggest that functional loss and hyperactivation of other transport motors also cause ROS-dependent and -independent microtubule-curling, which could therefore represent two fundamental pathways that link transport motors to microtubule bundle decay and neurodegeneration.",

Although cell contacts are reinforced by actomyosin contractility, which generates tension that propagates across the apical surface, how epithelial cells tune tension to reinforce junctions without compromising their physical barrier properties remains unclear. Herein, we report that Sperm Flagellar 1 (Spef1) is a microvillar component enriched in the apical domain and terminal web of enterocytes that prevents actomyosin hypercontractility. The loss of function of Spef1 in Caco-2 BBE cells induced invaginations of the apical domain at tricellular contacts, with a redistribution of the tricellular and tight junction components. These changes were driven by an increase in the NM2A:NM2C heavy chain ratio, which elevated tension throughout the apical surface and ultimately compromised barrier function. These findings highlight Spef1 as a microvillar resident that tunes actomyosin contractility across the apical surface to a level appropriate for junctional reinforcement and maintenance of epithelial function.",

    "abstract": "Soil detritivores represent a major portion of terrestrial biodiversity and biomass. Their feeding activity accelerates the turnover of organic matter and nutrients, thereby enhancing energy and material flows within soil food webs. Yet, global environmental changes are increasingly disrupting terrestrial ecosystems, threatening soil detritivores and their ecological functions. We hypothesize that global environmental changes will result in a decline in the feeding activity of soil detritivores. To test this, we conduct a global meta-analysis, synthesizing 650 observations from 55 studies. Our results show that global environmental changes reduce the feeding activity of soil detritivores by 47.8% on average. Among GECs, climate change (-59.8%), chemical pollution (-57.6%), fire (-49.1%), and land-use intensification (-34%) exert the most pronounced detrimental effects. For climate change, drought (-68.9%) suppresses the feeding activity of soil detritivores to a far greater extent than warming (-25.4%). Notably, insecticides (-98.9%), fungicides (-59.7%), and heavy metals (-59.5%) are particularly harmful within chemical pollutants. The negative effects of land-use intensification are predominantly driven by mineral fertilization (-45.6%), whereas grazing (-20.3%) and tillage (-11.8%) have minor effects. The magnitude of reductions in soil detritivore feeding activity is strongly regulated by ecosystem type, soil properties (soil organic carbon and pH), and detritivore species richness and abundance. These findings suggest that global environmental change-induced declines in soil detritivore feeding activity may further impair energy transfer within soil food webs, with far-reaching implications for key ecosystem functioning in a rapidly changing global environment.",

    "abstract": "Motor proteins perform essential roles in spindle assembly and division, but little is known about the forces that motors produce in spindles. Here, we report new tension sensors designed to measure loads across a kinesin-14 motor protein that both slides and crosslinks microtubules in spindles. The new tension sensors are motors that show active motility in vitro-they also produce fluorescence in spindles that is sensitive to loads across the motor. We find that assembling and mature spindles respond differently to increased loads caused by osmotic shock and show differences in binding by the tension-sensor motors. Binding to spindles that are still forming is dominated by rapid, transient microtubule binding and unbinding and sliding interactions. By contrast, the motors bind tightly to mature spindles, crosslinking microtubules and resisting opposing forces, bearing higher loads. Tension sensors created from motor variants or mutants that bind more tightly to microtubules than wild type bear even greater loads. The higher motor loads in mature spindles greatly exceed the forces that the wild-type motor produces-this implies that the motor in mature spindles acts primarily to oppose forces from microtubule dynamics or other motors rather than producing force as a motor. Thus, our studies define mechanical states of a spindle motor that are characterized by loads and microtubule-binding interactions and dominated by microtubule sliding or crosslinking, resisting opposing forces. These findings provide a new way of thinking about how motors create tension and contribute to forces in the spindle.",

    "abstract": "Microbial competition serves as a fundamental driver for the evolution of offensive and defensive mechanisms among microorganisms. While it is well established that bacteria utilize specialized secretion systems to deliver both toxic and non-toxic effector proteins into competing cells, thereby directly killing them or modulating cellular events, it remains largely unclear whether bacteria can hijack effector proteins derived from competitors to resolve interspecies conflicts. Here, we demonstrate that Pseudomonas protegens employs a sophisticated defense strategy, hijacking LtaE, a non-cytotoxic effector delivered via the type IV secretion system (T4SS) of non-flagellated Lysobacter enzymogenes, to resolve interbacterial conflict through transcriptional reprogramming. Translocated LtaE neutralizes an uncharacterized antibacterial toxin in P. protegens. Surprisingly, as a countermeasure, P. protegens hijacks LtaE to rewire its host signaling hierarchy, converting it into a motility activation switch. Mechanistically, LtaE directly binds to FleQ, the \u03c354-dependent master regulator of flagellar biosynthesis, shielding it from inhibitory c-di-guanosine monophosphate (GMP) binding-a universal second messenger whose elevated concentration typically inhibits bacterial motility and promotes biofilm formation. Remarkably, the LtaE-FleQ complex remains stable under high c-di-GMP conditions, overriding sessility signals to derepress flagellar gene expression and trigger escape motility. Biochemical analyses reveal that LtaE broadly targets FleQ homologs across pseudomonads through competitive inhibition of c-di-GMP binding, linking competitor detection to motility activation. Our findings establish a novel bacterial conflict-resolution paradigm, demonstrating how non-cytotoxic effectors act as molecular switches to dynamically reprogram transcriptional networks and enhance phenotypic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Motivation often diminishes under aversive conditions. Clinically, motivational deficits are linked to psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, yet the neural mechanisms by which aversive contexts suppress motivation remain unclear. Although classical theories associate motivation with the expected value of outcomes, less is known about the neural circuits that govern effort-based behavioral initiation. To address this, we dissociated motivational drive from goal valuation using an approach-avoidance (Ap-Av) task, in which macaques evaluated outcomes combining reward and punishment (air puffs to the face). As a control, we employed an approach-approach (Ap-Ap) task based solely on reward. Using chemogenetic manipulation, we found that selective inhibition of the ventral striatum to ventral pallidum (VS-VP) pathway restored the motivation to initiate trials in the Ap-Av task without affecting goal valuation. No effects were observed in the Ap-Ap task. These findings provide causal evidence that the VS-VP pathway mediates motivational suppression in aversive contexts. Electrophysiological recordings revealed rapid VS responses to aversive cues and a gradual decrease in VP activity, suggesting an inhibitory interaction in which elevated VS activity dampens VP output to limit initiation. The slower VP dynamics may reflect a process by which aversive signals are gradually integrated to influence the motivational state. Together, these results identify the VS-VP pathway as a key circuit by which aversive contexts suppress effort-based behavioral initiation, highlighting it as a potential target for treating motivational deficits in depression and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one of the most economically important crops in the world, but every year, pathogens cause billions of dollars' worth of losses worldwide. The domestication of this critical crop was associated with several severe genetic bottlenecks that resulted in a dramatic loss of genetic diversity (\u223c50%) relative to its wild progenitor. Although domestication selected for favorable agricultural traits, it is unclear how the reduced genetic diversity affected the immunity landscape of cultivated soybean relative to its wild ancestors. We performed a comprehensive screen for effector-triggered immune (ETI) responses of both cultivated soybean (Glycine max) and wild soybean (Glycine soja) against the bacterial speck pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. We uncovered an extensive ETI landscape in both species, with 121/529 alleles (22.9%) from 32/65 effector families (49.2%) eliciting ETI in G. max and 125/529 alleles (23.6%) from 23/65 effector families (35.4%) eliciting ETI in G. soja. Interestingly, soybean recognized all three effectors encoded in the conserved effector locus (CEL) of P. syringae (AvrE, HopM, and HopAA), providing pervasive and stacked resistance against this common soybean pathogen. Finally, we demonstrate that pretreatment of soybean with the CEL effectors can immunize soybean against subsequent infection. Overall, we have defined the ETI landscape of soybean against P. syringae and demonstrated that domestication has not compromised soybean immunodiversity despite a dramatic loss in genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "The current biodiversity landscape results from hundreds of millions of years of evolution, yet the accumulation of biodiversity has been punctuated by mass extinctions. A key question is how surviving lineages rebuilt diversity after extinction events. Here, we examine the morphological and taxonomic recovery of three clades (i.e., ammonoids, brachiopods, and ostracods) that experienced selective extinction during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction (PTME) event. Using a deep learning method-based tool for automatic extraction of morphological features, combined with quantitative taxonomic diversity measures, we find two main paths of biotic recovery following the PTME: refilling mode, in which ammonoids and brachiopods rebound in biodiversity by refilling the vacated morphospace with limited innovation, leading to a partial recovery of their previous disparity and taxonomic diversity, and expansion mode, in which ostracods underwent an adaptive radiation, with their morphospace expanding rapidly during the Early-Middle Triassic and then stabilizing post-Triassic. Their ecological niches expanded substantially during the post-Paleozoic, and their diversity exceeded its pre-extinction level during the Jurassic. These findings suggest that rapid morphological diversification could facilitate ecological expansion and thereby foster long-term growth in taxonomic diversity. The PTME played a fundamental role in reshaping marine ecosystem structure by triggering different recovery trajectories among survivors.",

    "abstract": "In response to increased intracellular calcium, the formin INF2 polymerizes 20-30% of the total cellular actin pool within 30 s, suggesting robust regulation. INF2 regulation requires an autoinhibitory interaction between the N-terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) and the C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). DID mutations are dominantly linked to two human diseases and constitutively activate INF2. However, DAD binding to actin monomers competes with DID binding, disrupting regulation. Here, we use a novel cell-free assay for the detailed investigation of INF2 regulation. Contrary to our previous findings, INF2 inhibition does not require CAP proteins but does require actin \"buffering\" by monomer-binding proteins such as profiling or thymosin. INF2 is activated by calcium-bound calmodulin (CALM) through CALM binding to the N terminus. In addition, the N terminus plays an important role in INF2 regulation beyond CALM binding. These findings support a role of actin monomer-binding proteins not only in regulating overall actin dynamics but also in specific regulation of an actin polymerization factor.",

Driving clearance of cytoplasmic TDP-43 reduces toxicity in ALSO models, though how TDP-43 clearance is regulated remains controversial. We conducted an unbiased yeast screen using high-throughput dot blotting to identify genes that affect TDP-43 levels. We identified ESCRT complex genes, which induce membrane invagination (particularly at multivesicular bodies; MVBs) and genes linked to K63 ubiquitination (particularly cofactors of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5; NEDD4 in humans), as drivers of TDP-43 endolysosomal clearance. TDP-43 colocalized and bound Rsp5/NEDD4 and ESCRT proteins, and perturbations to either increased TDP-43 aggregation, stability, and toxicity. NEDD4 also ubiquitinates TDP-43. Lastly, TDP-43 accumulation induces giant MVB-like vesicles, within which TDP-43 accumulates in a NEDD4-dependent manner. Our studies shed light on endolysosomal-mediated cytoplasmic protein clearance, a poorly understood proteostasis mechanism, which may help identify novel ALSO therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Importins could inhibit the condensation of RNA-binding proteins, while it remains unknown whether exportins elicit a similar function. Here, we identified that exportin CRM1 binds to the nuclear protein NPAT, which initiates and maintains the formation of the histone locus body (HLB), a membraneless nuclear body regulating histone transcription. CRM1 drives the nuclear export of NPAT by targeting a nuclear export signal (NES) within the LisH domain. The LisH domain contributes to NPAT condensation by mediating its self-association. Mechanistically, CRM1 competitively occupies the self-association sites in the NES motif, thereby suppressing NPAT condensation. In contrast, the two recurrent CRM1 E571K and E571G mutants could not regulate NPAT condensation and HLB remodeling due to their impaired binding to the NES of NPAT. Based on the \"competitive occupation\" model, we designed a LisH domain-derived short peptide that competes with homotypic intermolecular interactions of NPAT to perturb HLB formation. Our findings reveal that exportin regulates nuclear protein condensation via a competitive occupation strategy.",

    "abstract": "Insect cuticles with nano-level structures exhibit functional surface properties such as the photonic nanocrystal of the butterfly wing scale with structural color and the corneal nipple arrays of superhydrophobic compound eye lens. Despite the enormous influence the cuticle has had on biomimetic industrial applications, cellular mechanisms of cuticular nanopatterning remain poorly understood. Drosophila gore-tex/Osiris23 (gox) controls the formation of nanopores, with a molecular filtering function, on the olfactory organs. Here we used 3D electron microscopy imaging of entire hair structures to show that nanopore is formed through a novel process of bidirectional interaction of the ER and the plasma membrane trafficking. ER-resident protein Gox stimulates ER-phagy through regulation of Ref(2)P, the fly counterpart of the autophagy protein p62/SQSTM1, and initiates endocytosis. Dynamin on the plasma membrane completes endocytosis and sustains ER-phagy. The repurposing of ER-phagy for plasma membrane remodeling and the fabrication of nanoscale ECM structures sheds light on the nanopatterning mechanism of insect cuticles and their genetic control.",

    "abstract": "Lipid scramblases allow passive flip-flop of phospholipids between bilayer leaflets, thereby promoting membrane symmetry. At the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where phospholipid synthesis is restricted to one leaflet, scramblase activity should be essential for equilibrated membrane growth. The yeast protein Ist2 contains an ER domain and a cytosolic tail that binds the plasma membrane and participates in the transfer of phosphatidylserine. We show both in vitro and in silico that the ER domain of Ist2, which bears homology to the TMEM16 proteins, possesses a lipid scramblase activity that is not regulated by Ca2+. In cells, overexpression or deletion of the ER domain of Ist2 affects ER-related processes including COPII-mediated vesicular transport, lipid droplet homeostasis, and general phospholipid transport, with a specific contribution of residues implicated in lipid scrambling. The weak phenotypes can be augmented by the deletion of another putative scramblase, the protein insertase Get1, suggesting that the combined action of different proteins supports lipid scrambling at the ER.",

    "abstract": "To adapt behavior in changing environments, animals must continuously re-evaluate previously learned associations. This flexibility of memory systems has been identified as a promising strategy to target maladaptive memories. Here, we show that re-exposure to an unconditioned stimulus (US) alone, a sugar reward, can re-evaluate appetitive memories in Drosophila melanogaster. Using olfactory conditioning, we demonstrate that unpaired US exposure after memory formation reduces conditioned responses to multiple odor-reward associations. This reduction is specific to the re-exposure of the trained US and does not result from an altered motivational state or generalized behavioral suppression. Importantly, this US-induced memory devaluation engages mechanisms distinct from dopamine-driven modulation of memory accessibility, indicating a separate process of memory re-evaluation. Moreover, we find that sugar re-exposure diminishes both short- and long-term memory phases and can act on consolidated memories, suggesting broad temporal applicability. Notably, this devaluation does not change the reward-memory trace in specific mushroom body output neurons, implying that the underlying memory trace remains intact despite behavioral suppression. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which reward re-experience pervasively devalues associated memories, offering a potential approach to target multiple memories without requiring re-exposure to individual cues. This work provides insight into how experience can broadly reshape memory networks and may inform future approaches for persistent memory modification.",

    "title": "Integrative Multiomics and Drug Sensitivity Profiling Reveal Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Strategies in Pediatric Solid Tumors.",
    "abstract": "Cure rates for childhood malignancies using established therapy protocols have increased to an average of 80% but have reached a plateau. Moreover, survival rates are particularly low for some pediatric tumors-such as high-risk group 3 medulloblastomas, osteosarcomas, Ewing sarcomas, high-risk neuroblastomas, and high-grade gliomas-and dismal for patients with relapsed malignancies. A functional drug response profiling platform for pediatric solid and brain tumors has been established within the INFORM program to identify patient-specific vulnerabilities and biomarkers and to unravel molecular mechanisms associated with drug response profiles for clinical translation. In this study, we performed a multiomics analysis using drug sensitivity profiles, as well as genomic and transcriptomic data, of 81 pediatric solid tumor samples. The integrative analysis suggested two multiomics signatures associated with drug sensitivity. One signature distinguished neuroblastoma samples with sensitivity to navitoclax, a BCL2 family inhibitor. A second signature was specific to a subset of Wilms tumors harboring the SIX1 (Q177R) hotspot mutation that displayed high expression of MGAM, PTPN14, STAT4, and KDM2B and high sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. A patient-specific causal interaction network analysis suggested possible molecular interactions between MEK inhibitors and the SIX1 mutation in Wilms tumor samples. In conclusion, the integration of drug sensitivity profiling and multiomics data revealed potential biomarkers that may be associated with drug sensitivity in pediatric solid tumors. Patient-specific causal interaction network analysis further elucidated the interaction between inhibitors and signature biomarkers, providing insights that may inform clinical translation.\nThe combination of multiomics analysis and drug sensitivity profiling identified two signatures related to drug sensitivity in pediatric solid tumors, contributing to the advancement of functional precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies.

Beyond their supportive functions, such as encapsulation and signaling, somatic cells also act as tissue-resident, non-professional phagocytes. In Drosophila testis, somatic cyst cells eliminate approximately a quarter of newly emerged spermatogonial progenitors, a role seemingly contradictory to their supportive function. Here, we examined individual events in which cyst cells alternated between supporting germ cells and promoting their death, revealing distinct morphological features. Our data indicate that, in addition to well-defined cyst cells derived from stem cell divisions and escorting differentiating spermatogonia, a distinct population of long-lived steady cyst cells arises during larval development. These steady cyst cells persist at the apical tip of the testis for extended periods and engage in phagoptosis. This distinction separates cyst cells into two subpopulations based on function and morphology, highlighting how genetically similar cells adopt specialized roles depending on their developmental origin and timing.",

    "abstract": "Spastic paraplegia 21 is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of corticospinal axons. It is caused by mutations in the SPG21 gene, which encodes maspardin, a cytosolic protein of unknown function that associates with the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane. Intriguingly, we found that the phosphorylation level of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of the CLEAR gene network, is decreased in SPG21 knockout cells, leading to TFEB nuclear translocation. Our investigations revealed that the Rag-mediated presentation of TFEB to the mTOR kinase and its subsequent phosphorylation is disturbed by a delocalization of the RAB7 GTPase, a maspardin-binding partner, from retromer-positive late endosomes to lysosomes. This redistribution decreases the interaction between RAB7 and its GTPase-activating protein (GAP), TBC1D5. Consequently, RAB7 remains primarily GTP-bound, recruiting more FYCO1 to lysosomes and promoting the anterograde movement of these organelles along microtubules. These findings identify maspardin as a newly discovered RAB7 effector and shed light on several consequences of its deficiency.",

We developed a dynamic live-imaging platform with analytical capabilities to track subcellular structures throughout the parasite's 48-h intraerythrocytic life cycle. Our analysis revealed four distinct morphological stages in apicoplast development that correlate with nuclear replication. We identified a critical \"Crown\" morphology stage required for nucleus-apicoplast attachment, where the apicoplast stretches across multiple nuclei, in close association with centriolar plaques. We measured DNA ploidy and replication dynamics of the nuclear and apicoplast genomes. Inhibition of nuclear DNA replication blocked apicoplast biogenesis at early stages, demonstrating dependence on S-phase initiation. Conversely, inhibiting apicoplast genome replication minimally affected organelle development but disrupted the Crown stage, preventing proper organelle segregation into daughter cells. These findings establish a central pathway connecting apicoplast development to the cell cycle and an independent mechanism governing organelle inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Intratumoral heterogeneity supports cancer progression and metastasis while limiting therapeutic efficacy. Comprehensive biological characterization of heterogeneous subclones in breast cancer may hold promise in battling against this deadly disease. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis and in situ profiling of primary tumors, metastases, and circulating tumor cells from multiple patients with breast cancer, we identified a unique EPCAM+ CD68+ TREM2+ tumor subpopulation, likely resulting from the fusion of tumor cells and lipid-associated macrophages (LAM). The presence of these tumor-LAM fusion cells in the blood or in distinct metastatic sites was significantly correlated with metastatic progression. Stable fusion clonal lines established in vitro exhibited substantially enhanced proliferation, tumor initiation, and metastasis formation in mice. Integrative molecular and functional analyses revealed a critical role for SNX10 in mediating tumor-LAM fusion. Mechanistically, SNX10 physically interacted with the phospholipid scramblase ANO6 and maintained its protein stability by suppressing proteasome-mediated degradation. Furthermore, the transcription factor CBX3 directly targeted SNX10 promoter and modulated its expression. Fusion cells accumulated abundant intracellular lipid droplets and were highly sensitive to simvastatin treatment in vitro and in vivo. Together, this study uncovered that CBX3-SNX10-ANO6 signaling facilitates generation of an aggressive tumor-LAM fusion cell subpopulation that promotes metastasis, revealing an alternative metastatic mechanism and exposing putative therapeutic vulnerabilities.\nSingle-cell transcriptomic profiling combined with functional and clinical validation identifies fusion of tumor cells and lipid-associated macrophages mediated by the CBX3-SNX10-ANO6 axis as a potentially targetable mechanism driving cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Many processes such as polarized growth and secretion require specific actin networks. In fungi, cell-cell fusion requires cell wall digestion mediated by local secretion of lytic enzymes. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the myosin V Myo52 transports enzyme-containing secretory vesicles on the actin fusion focus, an aster-like actin network assembled by the condensate-forming formin Fus1. The fusion focus also concentrates proteins regulating cell polarity, communication, cytoskeleton, exocytosis, and membrane merging. Here, using centroid tracking and averaging, we present a spatiotemporal map of the fusion site with 8-nm precision. We show that a pool of vesicles remains at constant distance from the membrane as the actin structure condenses. Unexpectedly, Myo52 detaches from this pool and colocalizes with Fus1 closer to the membrane. We show that Myo52 binds Fus1 and transports it along actin filaments, and that Myo52 and Fus1 actin assembly activity contribute to focus compaction. Thus, myosin V-driven transport of formin Fus1 along Fus1-nucleated actin filaments underlies positive feedback for actin aster formation.",

    "abstract": "Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), which contain both glucose and fructose, have been linked to an increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Their effects on colorectal cancer progression, however, are unclear. In their recent work, Feng and colleagues investigated how exposure to SSBs affects colorectal cancer metastasis. They discovered that several colorectal cancer cell lines showed enhanced migration when exposed to glucose and fructose together, compared with cells exposed to glucose or fructose alone. Similarly, in mouse models of colorectal cancer liver metastasis, mice fed both glucose and fructose developed more liver metastases, suggesting that SSBs promote colorectal cancer spread. Leveraging metabolomic analyses, they discovered that in the presence of both glucose and fructose, the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) converts fructose to sorbitol, regenerating NAD+ from NADH. Deleting SORD reduced the NAD+/NADH ratio and colorectal cancer cell migration and metastasis. Restoring the NAD+/NADH ratio rescued migration, suggesting that SORD-driven NAD+ regeneration promotes metastatic behavior. Furthermore, they demonstrated that increased NAD+/NADH levels have a profound effect on cell metabolism, supporting glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the mevalonate pathway. Interestingly, pharmacologic inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with statins reduced cell migration and liver metastasis in mice consuming SSBs. Together, these findings demonstrate that SSBs enhance colorectal cancer metastasis through SORD-dependent metabolic reprogramming. By regenerating NAD+ and glycolysis and supporting the mevalonate pathway, SORD links SSB consumption to increased tumor cell migration and metastatic potential.",

Specifically, HSATII RNA sequesters RNA methylation factors. HSATII-YBX-1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formation is mediated by HSATII double-stranded RNA and RNA methylase NSUN2 activity. Aberrant HSATII-RNP complexes affect RNA processing pathways, including RNA splicing. Differential splicing of genes mediated by HSATII-RNP complexes is associated with pathways known to be dysregulated by DUX4 expression. These findings highlight the broader influence of DUX4 on nuclear RNA dynamics and suggest that HSATII RNA could be a critical mediator of RNA processing regulation.

Here we report that in the fusion stage of osteoclast formation, each of these shared hallmarks of cell fusion represents a step in a novel signaling pathway. A rise in intracellular Ca2+ activates a lipid scramblase that translocates PS from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This redistribution is enhanced by binding of extracellular Anx A5 to PS. Depletion of PS in the inner leaflet weakens actin cortex-plasma membrane attachment, as evidenced by the preferential localization of the cortex detachment areas within PS-enriched regions at the cell surface. Weakening of the cortex attachment promotes osteoclast fusion. Based on these findings and theoretical analysis, we propose that PS exposure-to-cortex detachment pathway facilitates pre-fusion membrane contacts and fusion pore expansion in osteoclast fusion and other cell-cell fusions by promoting outward membrane deformations with locally elevated tension.",

We used the retention using selective hooks system to monitor the localization of new integrins exiting the endoplasmic reticulum in space and time. We discovered that new integrin delivery to the plasma membrane is polarized and enhances cell protrusion and focal adhesion growth in an extracellular matrix-ligand-dependent manner. Motor-clutch modeling explained the increased adhesion as higher integrin availability driving recruitment of additional receptors. Unexpectedly, live-cell imaging revealed a small subset of fast-emerging integrin vesicles rapidly transported to the cell surface to facilitate localized spreading. This unconventional secretion depended on cell adhesion and correlated with increased surface levels of immature, high-mannose glycosylated integrin, indicating bypass of the canonical Golgi-dependent secretory pathway. Thus, spatial plasma membrane-targeting of new integrins rapidly alters adhesion receptor availability, providing cells with added plasticity to respond to their environment.",

The postsynaptic neuroligins NL1/3 and NL2/3/4 localize to excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively, and regulate the corresponding neurotransmitter receptors. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that determine synaptic specificity via defined combinations of neuroligins and neurotransmitter receptors remain unclear. We found that all neuroligin isoforms form a tripartite complex with GABAA receptors and GARLH4 protein, with isoform-specific preferences, and that NL1, previously thought to be restricted to excitatory synapses, is also present at inhibitory synapses. In the absence of inhibitory synapse-specific NL2/4, NL1/3 increasingly assembles with GARLH4/GABAA receptors and relocates to inhibitory synapses. Moreover, forced interaction between NL1 and GARLH4 redirects their localization to inhibitory synapses. These findings demonstrate that GARLHs regulate the synaptic specificity of neuroligins, providing the key link between neuroligins and inhibitory GABAA receptors.",

How these enzymes couple Microtubule binding with ATP hydrolysis to trigger microtubule-remodeling remains poorly understood. Using Caenorhabditiselegans Katanin, which contains the MEI-1 catalytic AAA+ p60 and MEI-2 p80-like regulatory subunits, we identify a critical regulatory role of the N-terminal domain of MEI-1 in Katanin regulation. We demonstrate this domain represses the AAA+ core in cis, limiting ATP hydrolysis and preventing interaction with tubulin C-terminal tails in the absence of MEI-2. Strikingly, MEI-1 lacking its N terminus is constitutively active, enabling identification of pore residues critical for sensing microtubule C-terminal tails and relaying this signal to the AAA+ core. These findings reveal how Katanin activation is coupled to microtubule binding, thereby avoiding futile ATP hydrolysis. Given Katanin's evolutionary conservation, our work provides a mechanistic framework for its regulation in other organisms, with broader implications for human pathologies, including neurodegeneration and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death due to a lack of effective therapeutic interventions. PDAC tumors are highly fibrotic, and stromal abundance is hypothesized to contribute to patient outcomes. However, stromal fibroblasts can be tumor promoting and tumor restraining, which could explain the disappointing clinical results of stromal-targeting therapies. In this study, we observed that serum levels of stromal biomarkers associated with favorable outcomes were significantly higher in female patients with PDAC compared with male patients. This was supported by in silico estimates of stromal abundance across solid cancers, as well as magnetic resonance elastography and tissue staining, which revealed that female patients with PDAC had stiffer tumor tissue. Gene expression analysis revealed that estrogen signaling instructs a stromal fibroblast phenotype that is associated with relatively indolent molecular subtypes and a more favorable prognosis, which is maintained by stromal expression of C-type lectin CLEC3B. Remarkably, estrogens were detected intratumorally, and pancreatic cancer cells expressed key enzymes for estrogen synthesis. Estrogen production in PDAC was fueled by the catabolism of stroma-derived branched-chain amino acids, which ultimately resulted in the production of steroid hormone precursors. Together, these data reveal important hormone-driven factors that limit tumor progression by reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and provide leads for therapy development for PDAC.\nEstrogen produced by pancreatic cancer cells alters the phenotype of cancer-associated fibroblasts to shape a tumor-suppressive microenvironment that hampers aggressive disease phenotypes, which could guide the development of stromal-targeted therapies.

Particularly, ESR1 mutations that induce constitutive ER activation drove aberrant lipid biogenesis and lipid upload in parallel with increased expression of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), which plays a crucial role in fatty acid activation and has been shown to correlate with increased ferroptosis susceptibility. Although ER+ breast cancer cells displayed ferroptosis resistance, the presence of ESR1 mutations rendered tumor cells sensitive to ferroptosis induction. Importantly, ferroptosis inducers potentiated the effects of the selective ER degraders fulvestrant and elacestrant, which are the standard of care for breast cancers carrying ESR1 mutations. These findings, validated both in preclinical models and in patient-derived material, identify a combinatory therapeutic approach in the setting of ET resistance and establish ACSL4 as an important biomarker to recognize ER+ breast cancers susceptible to ferroptosis induction.\nESR1 mutations in breast cancer induce metabolic changes that trigger ferroptosis sensitivity, enabling ferroptosis inducers to enhance selective ER degraders' efficacy and positioning ACSL4 as a biomarker for guiding therapy in endocrine-resistant disease.",

    "abstract": "EGFR mutations are common oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and approximately half of patients develop brain metastases over the course of their disease. Patients with nonclassic EGFR mutations, such as insertions in exon 20, are a high unmet need with a worse prognosis compared with patients with classic EGFR mutations. Here, we describe the discovery and development of enozertinib (formerly ORIC-114), a highly brain-penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor that targets EGFR exon 20 mutations with unparalleled kinome selectivity. Preclinical studies revealed strong potency and tumor regressions driven by enozertinib across a broad range of atypical EGFR-mutant models. In a phase I clinical trial of enozertinib in patients with advanced NSCLC bearing atypical mutations in EGFR, a patient harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion experienced sustained complete response of all systemic and brain metastases. Together, these findings identify enozertinib as a promising investigational inhibitor to address the unmet need for brain-penetrant therapies in NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions or other atypical mutations.\nPreclinical and initial phase I clinical data demonstrate the potency, kinome selectivity, efficacy, and brain penetration of enozertinib in NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions and atypical mutations, warranting further clinical development.",

    "title": "USP20-Driven Cholesterol Metabolism Links Inflammatory Signaling to Malignancy and Stromal Coevolution in Pancreatic Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Inflammatory signaling, metabolic reprogramming, and stromal complexity have emerged as core hallmarks of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Cross-talk between these programs could represent potential targets to concurrently perturb multiple tumor-promoting processes. By integrating multiomics data from clinical cohorts, patient-derived organoids, and autochthonous models, we uncovered tumor-intrinsic inflammatory cascades in PDAC as master regulators of mevalonate pathway hijacking, which drove both malignant progression and stromal coevolution. TNFSF13B+ tumor-associated macrophages activated STAT3 signaling in neoplastic epithelia, leading to the transcriptional upregulation of USP20. This deubiquitinase stabilized HMGCR to potentiate mevalonate flux, resulting in cholesterol and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate overproduction. Stimulation of YAP/TAZ signaling induced by the USP20-mediated metabolic alterations promoted tumor cell proliferation and triggered the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of USP20 using a selective inhibitor reversed tumor metabolic dysregulation, suppressing both tumor growth and stromal desmoplasia. Furthermore, the combination of USP20 inhibition and anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy resulted in enhanced antitumor efficacy. These findings reveal the STAT3-USP20-HMGCR axis as a central coordinator of PDAC malignancy and position USP20 inhibition as a strategy to suppress oncogenic signaling, perturb metabolic reprogramming, and reverse microenvironmental remodeling.\nTargeting USP20 disrupts coevolution of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the tumor microenvironment and enhances immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by blocking mevalonate metabolism rewiring, providing a dual-action therapeutic approach for pancreatic cancer.",

    "title": "Tumor-Associated Macrophages Produce PGE2 to Promote CD8+ T-cell Exhaustion and Drive Resistance to PD-L1 Blockade in Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade treatment is highly effective in microsatellite-instable (MSI) colorectal cancer. However, microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors, which represent 95% of metastatic colorectal cancer, are intrinsically resistant to immunotherapy. In this study, we sought to better understand the mechanisms of resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy in colorectal cancer by characterizing the immune profiles of MSS and MSI tumor models. Although both tumor types presented intratumoral CD8+ T-cell responses and PD-L1 expression, the exhausted CD8+ T-cell phenotypes differed. In MSS tumors, exhausted CD8+ T cells coexpressed PD-1 and T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and exhibited a terminal exhausted profile with low cytokine secretion and limited cytotoxic function. In contrast, PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in MSI tumors did not express TIGIT and displayed higher cytokine and cytotoxic activities. Interestingly, immunosuppressive M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) accumulated in MSI tumors and positively correlated with PD-1+ TIGIT+ CD8+ T-cell frequency. M2-like TAM depletion reduced TIGIT expression, increased CD8+ T-cell function, and improved efficacy of PD-L1 blockade. Transcriptomic analysis revealed elevated COX1/2 expression in TAMs in MSS tumors compared with MSI tumors. COX2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor inhibition impeded TIGIT expression and restored CD8+ T-cell activity, whereas PGE2 triggered TIGIT upregulation in CD8+ T cells. Single-cell, spatial, and bulk transcriptomic data from patients with colorectal cancer substantiated the correlation between elevated TIGIT in CD8+ T-cell and COX1/2 in TAMs. Together, these data uncover the role of the TAM axis in inhibiting PD-L1 efficacy in MSS colorectal cancer and support the utility of combining anti-PD-L1 therapy with TIGIT blockade, PGE2 treatment, or M2-like TAM inhibition in colorectal cancer.\nTargeting PGE2 signaling activated by tumor-associated macrophages sensitizes microsatellite-stable colon tumors to immune checkpoint blockade by limiting the emergence of an exhausted PD-1+ TIGIT+ CD8+ T population.",

    "title": "Targeting the ATM-TGS1-BRCA1 Axis Overcomes Genotoxic Therapy Resistance in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains one of the most lethal malignancies, primarily due to its robust resistance to genotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this resistance is essential to improve clinical outcomes. In this study, we identified trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1), previously known for its role in RNA modification, as a critical mediator of homologous recombination (HR) repair that specifically contributes to resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. TGS1 was significantly overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues, correlating strongly with advanced disease stages, therapy resistance, and poor patient prognosis. Following DNA damage, ATM kinase phosphorylated TGS1 at serine residues S389 and S531, which mediated its direct interaction with BRCA1 and subsequent recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction enhanced HR repair efficiency, enabling cancer cells to survive genotoxic stress. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of TGS1 induced HR deficiency and markedly enhanced sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, particularly PARP inhibitors, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro and in both cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models in vivo. Collectively, these findings uncover an ATM-TGS1-BRCA1 signaling axis that promotes DNA repair and resistance to genotoxic therapies in pancreatic cancer, positioning TGS1 as a promising predictive biomarker and therapeutic target to enhance treatment efficacy.\nThe ATM-TGS1-BRCA1 signaling axis is a critical regulator of DNA repair that can be targeted to overcome genotoxic therapy resistance, providing a promising therapeutic strategy that could transform pancreatic cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "NK cell-redirecting therapies are emerging as promising \"off the shelf\" cancer treatments with fewer safety issues compared with T cell-directed therapies. In this study, we developed ABBV-303, a c-Met-targeted multispecific NK-cell engager. ABBV-303 included three functional arms: (i) a c-Met-binding single-chain variable fragment; (ii) a Fab that binds NKG2D, a stimulatory receptor on NK cells, and activated CD8+ T cells; and (iii) a heterodimeric IgG1 Fc that binds Fc\u03b3RIIIa on NK cells. ABBV-303 binding to NKG2D and Fc\u03b3RIIIa redirected NK cells to lyse c-Met-expressing tumor cells and induced CD8+ T-cell activation. The treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with ABBV-303 in the presence of c-Met+ tumor cells stimulated NK and CD8+ T cells as demonstrated by modulation of activation-associated surface proteins and release of soluble factors. ABBV-303 drove subnanomolar redirected killing potency against tumor cells from different solid tumor indications expressing a range of c-Met levels. ABBV-303 demonstrated antitumor activity against established xenografts in CD34-humanized, IL15 transgenic NOD/SCID-gamma mice and in a c-Met+ tumor explant. When compared with a CD3 bispecific with the same c-Met binder, ABBV-303 drove lower levels of inflammatory cytokines at equivalent levels of tumor cell killing and enhanced tolerance of normal cells expressing c-Met, consistent with the natural tendency of NK cells to preferentially react with stressed or cancer cells as compared with normal, healthy tissue. Together, this study showed that ABBV-303 is effective at driving antitumor immunity against a wide range of c-Met-expressing tumors.\nABBV-303 is a biologic that engages and potently redirects NK cells and costimulates CD8+ T cells in c-Met expressing tumors while demonstrating relative tolerance of normal tissue-derived cells.",

    "title": "ROR\u03b3 Hijacks HIF1\u03b1 to Promote Peritoneal Metastasis of Gastric Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is the most common and lethal form of metastasis in gastric cancer, highlighting an urgent need for treatment strategies. In this study, we identified retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR\u03b3) as a key driver of PM in gastric cancer tumors. Integrative bioinformatics and IHC analyses revealed aberrant upregulation of ROR\u03b3 in gastric cancer tumors, particularly in metastatic lesions. Functionally, elevated ROR\u03b3 promoted gastric cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia and accelerated PM formation in vivo. The hypoxic microenvironment in gastric cancer stimulated ROR\u03b3 expression, which in turn enhanced hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) stability, establishing a positive feedforward loop. Mechanistically, ROR\u03b3 interacted with HIF1\u03b1 and protected it from binding to proline hydroxylase domain 3 and von Hippel-Lindau, resulting in markedly decreased HIF1\u03b1 hydroxylation and ubiquitylation and increased HIF1\u03b1 accumulation, nuclear translocation, and transactivation. The ROR\u03b3-HIF1\u03b1 complex bound to and activated target genes involved in the hypoxic response and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, thereby driving gastric cancer tumor growth and PM. Disruption of the ROR\u03b3-HIF1\u03b1 interaction using ROR\u03b3 antagonists markedly promoted HIF1\u03b1 degradation and diminished its function. Importantly, in multiple gastric cancer xenograft models, ROR\u03b3 inhibition effectively blocked tumor growth and PM while sensitizing tumors to chemotherapy. Thus, this study uncovers a mechanism of hypoxia-mediated metastasis through a ROR\u03b3-HIF1\u03b1 reciprocal regulatory loop and offers a potential therapeutic option against PM in advanced cancer.\nROR\u03b3 drives peritoneal metastasis in gastric cancer and can be targeted to block metastatic progression, suggesting that ROR\u03b3 inhibition could serve as a therapeutic strategy for advanced gastric cancer.",

    "title": "Neoplastic Immune Mimicry Potentiates Breast Tumor Progression.",
    "abstract": "Dedifferentiation programs are commonly enacted during breast cancer progression to enhance tumor cell fitness. Increased cellular plasticity within the neoplastic compartment of tumors correlates with disease aggressiveness, often culminating in greater resistance to cytotoxic therapies or augmented metastatic potential. In this study, we found that subpopulations of dedifferentiated neoplastic breast epithelial cells express canonical leukocyte cell surface receptor proteins and have thus named this cellular program \"immune mimicry.\" Analysis of public human breast tumor single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and histopathologic breast tumor specimens, as well as functional experiments in vitro in breast cancer cell lines and in vivo in murine transgenic and cell line-derived mammary cancer models, showed that neoplastic cells engaged in immune mimicry. Immune-mimicked neoplastic cells harbored hallmarks of dedifferentiation and were enriched in treatment-resistant and high-grade breast tumors. In aggressive breast cancer cell lines, antiproliferative cytotoxic chemotherapies drove epithelial cells toward immune mimicry. The expression of the CD69 leukocyte activation protein by neoplastic cells conferred a proliferative advantage that facilitated early tumor growth. Together, these findings suggest that neoplastic breast epithelial cells upregulating leukocyte surface receptors potentiate malignancy and that neoplastic immune mimicry has potential clinical utility for patient prognosis and stratification.\nA subset of neoplastic breast epithelial cells express surface receptors canonically attributed to leukocytes and are associated with therapy resistance and aggressive tumor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear paraspeckles play critical roles in orchestrating gene transcription to support tumor development and progression. Elucidating regulators of their dynamic compositions and formation could provide potential targets for treating cancer. In this study, we discovered that the short isoform of Wilms tumor gene on the X chromosome (WTX-S) specifically disrupted paraspeckle stability. WTX-S selectively interacted with and sequestered NONO (also as p54nrb) from paraspeckles. Mechanistically, interaction between WTX-S and NONO induced formation of nuclear bodies via liquid-liquid phase separation (WTX-NB). The coiled-coil domain 2 directly interacted with NONO-coiled-coil domain to compartmentalize paraspeckle proteins and subsequently disrupt paraspeckle stability. Functionally, the paraspeckle disintegration induced by WTX-NBs resulted in enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity and favorable prognosis in gastric cancer. Importantly, the cell-penetrating synthetic peptide WTXAP, based on the WTX-NONO interface, mimicked WTX-NB-mediated paraspeckle disintegration and exhibited potent antitumor activity. Likewise, treatment with KPT-330, an FDA-approved XPO1 inhibitor, significantly increased the extent of WTX-S-mediated paraspeckle disintegration, sensitizing WTXhigh gastric cancer to chemotherapy. Collectively, these findings characterize the function and potential clinical significance of WTX-NBs, offering a strategy for sensitizing gastric cancer to chemotherapy.\nWTX binding to NONO regulates the balance of biomolecular condensates, providing an axis that can be harnessed to perturb paraspeckles and improve chemotherapy sensitivity in gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "Understanding dormancy in prostate cancer is challenging because of model availability. In this study, using murine and human prostate cancer cell lines, we generated a stress-induced model of dormancy in vitro and demonstrated that the phenotype could be sustained upon intrailiac artery delivery into the bone marrow microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the transcription factor positive regulatory domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) was commonly upregulated in dormant prostate cancer cells compared with controls. Furthermore, bone marrow-disseminated prostate cancer cells from primary orthotopic tumors were largely positive for PRDM16. Genetic ablation and forced ectopic expression supported a role for PRDM16 in maintaining prostate cancer dormancy in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, PRDM16 negatively correlated with disease recurrence and with the E2F cell-cycle program in disseminated tumor cells derived from the bone marrow of patients with prostate cancer. Gene enrichment and characterization studies implicated PRDM16 as a regulator of metabolic and cell-cycle pathways. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR further revealed that PRDM16 binds upstream of the promoter of RB1, a potent repressor of E2F activity. Overall, this study developed a straightforward method for inducing cancer cell dormancy and applied this approach to find that PRDM16 governs an intrinsic dormancy program in prostate cancer.\nPRDM16 initiates a dormancy program in prostate cancer cells that is sustained in the bone marrow microenvironment, highlighting PRDM16 as a potential biomarker for relapse and target for eliminating dormant cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive metastatic cancer remains a major clinical challenge because of the unclear underlying mechanisms and the limited treatment options available. N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is a reversible modification of RNA that is frequently altered in cancer, and inhibitors targeting regulators of this process have been shown to block tumorigenesis. A better understanding of the role of m6A modifications in driving metastatic properties could help reveal potential strategies to prevent and treat metastasis. In this study, we discovered loss of the m6A writer complex component ZC3H13 as a key regulator of metastatic progression. Co-loss of ZC3H13 together with RB1 and BRCA2 occurred in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Functional in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that ZC3H13 loss changes m6A writer complex activity and target specificity, leading to decreased m6A methylation and increased stability of transcripts that promote migration and invasion. Treatment with FDA-approved m6A demethylase inhibitors effectively reduced the metastatic capabilities of ZC3H13-deficient cells. Together, these findings provide insights into how the m6A writer complex selectively methylates mRNAs, highlight the pathologic consequences of altered writer complex composition in cancer, and reveal therapeutic avenues for patients with metastatic cancer.\nFDA-approved m6A demethylase inhibitors can inhibit metastasis driven by ZC3H13 deficiency, which reduces m6A methylation of select transcripts involved in migration and invasion, providing potential therapeutic options for patients with metastatic cancer.",
