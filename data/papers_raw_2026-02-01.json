    "title": "Expert recommendations for the conduct and appraisal of qualitative research in oncology.",
    "abstract": "Qualitative research is essential in addressing unresolved problems in oncology, yet high-yield strategies to bolster qualitative approaches in cancer research are scarce. To promote the unique strengths of qualitative research and increase uptake in the field of oncology, qualitative methods should show quality and credibility on par with quantitative methods. This Review presents recommendations for applied qualitative cancer research generated by multidisciplinary experts who were invited to attend the Symposium on Applied Qualitative Research, held on Nov 11-12, 2024, based on their contributions to the field. First, we describe the interplay between quantitative and qualitative methods and discuss how current research standards for qualitative data reporting are necessary but insufficient for establishing rigour. Second, we propose expert recommendations comprising five key pillars-engagement, flexibility, transparency, transferability, and impact-with actionable examples for application across the cancer research continuum. We advocate for use of these recommendations in the design, conduct, analysis, dissemination, and appraisal of qualitative research in oncology to advance outcomes.",

    "title": "The power of words: evaluating the role of qualitative methods in cancer research.",
    "abstract": "This Review underscores qualitative research as an indispensable facet of scientific inquiry to improve provision of safe, effective, and affordable care for patients with cancer worldwide. Representing a global working group of applied qualitative researchers, our multidisciplinary authorship team defines qualitative research, characterises its purpose and value, and describes specific ways in which qualitative inquiry is central to advancing cures, treatment, and quality of life in oncology. In this Review, we put forward an imperative for the use of qualitative methods to assess context, understand population needs, design interventions, optimise implementation, and investigate mechanisms of action underpinning changes in health outcomes. We highlight the ways in which qualitative methods capture cultural context, making them crucial for scientific inquiry, and discuss the importance of using qualitative research to define research priorities, uncover and address understudied topics, and elevate marginalised voices globally. Ultimately, this Review serves as a call to action for improved integration of qualitative scholarship across each stage of cancer research and establishes a roadmap for collaboration among clinicians, scientists, publishers, and funders to recognise qualitative research as essential for scientific advancement in the field of oncology.",

    "abstract": "Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) is a serious complication of spinal metastases and primary spinal tumours that can severely affect quality of life and overall survival. Clinical trials have used inconsistent definitions, criteria, and endpoints, limiting comparability. We conducted a Delphi consensus process following a systematic review of prospective MSCC trials from Jan 1, 2003, to Feb 26, 2024. From June 25, 2024, to Jan 11, 2025, experts from 20 countries participated in two survey rounds, 74 in round 1 and 71 in round 2. Consensus was defined as over 75% agreement. 49 statements reached consensus, including definitions for clinical, radiological, and impending MSCC using the Bilsky scale. Experts agreed on baseline and follow-up assessments, including pain, motor and sensory function, ambulation, and urinary and anal sphincter function. Standardised functional scales, response criteria, endpoint definitions, and timing of assessments were established. A core set of mandatory and secondary endpoints was defined for different MSCC scenarios, along with minimum reporting standards for surgery and radiotherapy toxicity. These recommendations aim to standardise future MSCC trials and audits to improve data consistency and comparability.",

    "title": "Reirradiation Collaborative Group (ReCOG) consensus on standards for dose evaluation and reporting in patients with multiple courses of radiation therapy: an AAPM/ACRO/ASTRO/CARO/COMP/CADRA/CPQR/ESTRO/NRG-endorsed consensus statement.",
    "abstract": "As cancer survivors live longer, technologies improve, and reirradiation (reRT) becomes more common, standardised methods for the assessment and reporting of cumulative radiation doses are needed to allow treatment optimisation and integration with other medical specialties managing these complex patients. This consensus statement, developed by an international collaboration of radiation oncologists, physicists, and other experts in the Reirradiation Collaborative Group, proposes a framework for consistent evaluation, documentation, reporting, and clinical decision making in reRT. This paper outlines practical strategies for dose accumulation from multiple courses of radiation therapy with the use of both image registration-based and point dose-based methods, accounting for uncertainties in data availability, physiological organ recovery, and anatomical changes. The emphasis of the consensus statement is on institutional workflows, improved software tools, and better capture of longitudinal patient outcomes. We also highlight the need for improved biological models, data infrastructure, and cross-specialty collaboration. Ultimately, reRT is framed as a transformative challenge for oncology, demanding interdisciplinary innovation across science, clinical care, and health systems. Widespread adoption of these recommendations could accelerate progress toward improved outcomes for patients receiving reRT worldwide.",

    "title": "Classification accuracy of a hierarchical molecular inference-based deep-learning system for CNS tumour diagnosis: a multi-institutional, retrospective study.",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision empower deep-learning models to infer molecular features from histopathological images to classify CNS tumours. The aim of this study was to test the classification accuracy of a molecular inference-based AI assistant for CNS tumour diagnosis.\nIn this multi-institutional, retrospective study, we used data from whole slide images of samples from patients aged 0-95 years, diagnosed with primary or recurrent CNS tumours. Reference diagnostic labels were determined by DNA methylation-based tumour classification to match one of 52 tumour types selected to encompass most types of gliomas, embryonal tumours, and meningeal and mesenchymal tumours encountered in clinical practice. The Neuropath-AI model was trained on 5835 samples from the National Cancer Institute (NCI; USA), the Children's Brain Tumor Network (USA), and the Digital Brain Tumour Atlas (Austria) to infer molecular features from whole slide images and to use these to predict tumour types with associated confidence scores. The test cohort comprised 5516 samples identified in laboratory archives between May 17, 2024, and May 13, 2025, from the NCI, Northwestern Medicine (USA), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (USA), and University College London (UK). There were 2753 (50%) female and 2763 (50%) male patients, median age 43 years (IQR 25-59). The primary objective was to measure the classification accuracy of the model family-level and terminal classification predictions in test samples, with coprimary endpoints of sample coverage and prediction and balanced accuracy. Sample coverage was defined as samples receiving a model prediction with a confidence score above a specified threshold. Prediction accuracy and balanced accuracy were analysed in the covered samples (ie, those meeting the confidence criterion) and evaluated by comparing the top-1 or top-2 predictions with reference labels.\nFamily-level classifications were reached in 5299 (96%) of 5516 samples. Predictions to one of the terminal classifications with at least moderate confidence were reached for 4772 (87%) samples. The single highest-scoring classification matched the reference label in 3817 (95% CI 3770-3865; 80% [95% CI 79-81]) of 4772 samples (balanced accuracy 66% [95% CI 63-70]). The two highest-scoring classifications contained the reference label in 4103 (95% CI 4056-4152; 86% [95% CI 85-87]) of 4772 samples (balanced accuracy 75% [95% CI 71-78]).\nOur model provides the basis for a clinically applicable deep-learning assistant to improve human efficiency and accuracy of CNS tumour diagnosis. The model will be made publicly available and could be implemented to assist human pathologists in future prospective studies.\nThe Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health.",

    "title": "Estimated effect of correcting inequalities in minimally invasive surgical resection in patients with colon cancer in England: a population-based study.",
    "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgical resection offers advantages over open surgical resection in elective management of colon cancer. However, patients who are older, have comorbidities, or live in socioeconomically deprived areas are less likely to receive minimally invasive surgical resection. We aimed to estimate the potential effect on outcomes of correcting inequalities in minimally invasive surgical resection for colon cancer.\nIn this population-based study, we studied adult patients (aged 15-99 years) diagnosed with stage I-III carcinoma of the colon between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2022, and followed up to Dec 31, 2023, who underwent elective resection as recorded in linked cancer registration data in England. We excluded patients diagnosed through an emergency route, diagnosed with metastatic disease (stage IV), with missing stage, not resected, and who underwent colon cancer surgery in a private hospital or in a UK National Health Service (NHS) Trust that recorded ten or fewer colon cancer resections in 2022. Only Trusts doing both minimally invasive surgical and open surgical resections were included to ensure correct modelling of the effect of correcting inequalities in minimally invasive surgical resections within each Trust. We designed scenarios to correct inequalities in minimally invasive surgical resection in each UK NHS Trust, targeting four suboptimal uptake groups (patients who were aged 65 years and older, patients with frailty, patients with comorbidities, and patients with high levels of socioeconomic deprivation). We used a potential outcomes framework and contrasted observed and potential outcomes to estimate the effect of reducing inequalities in use of minimally invasive surgical resection on four primary outcomes: the lengths of index stay and total hospital stay, the probability of readmission within 30 days of resection, and 1-year mortality after resection.\nAll analyses included data for 10 603 elective colon resections done in 123 NHS Trusts. The median follow-up time was 1\u00b747 years (IQR 1\u00b722-1\u00b774). The mean age at diagnosis was 70\u00b73 years (SD 11\u00b74). 5487 (51\u00b77%) patients were male and 5116 (48\u00b73%) were female. Minimally invasive surgical resection was attempted in 8909 (84\u00b70%) and completed in 7951 (75\u00b70%), among whom there were substantial inequalities in the proportion of minimally invasive surgical resections among the four suboptimal uptake groups defined by age at diagnosis of 65 years and older (5495 [73\u00b78%] vs 2456 [77\u00b78%] in those younger than 65 years), most deprived quintiles (quintiles 3-5: 4114 [73\u00b79%] vs 3837 [76\u00b72%] in the least deprived quintiles), comorbidity (2348 [70\u00b78%] vs 5603 [76\u00b79%] in those without comorbidities), and a moderate or high frailty score (695 [64\u00b71%] vs 7256 [76\u00b72%] in those with a low frailty score). Patients with minimally invasive surgical resection had 3-day to 4-day shorter lengths of hospital stay than patients with open surgical resection. Proportions of 30-day readmission and 1-year mortality were lower in patients with minimally invasive surgical resection than in patients with open surgical resection (13\u00b71% vs 18\u00b71% and 2\u00b79% vs 7\u00b79%, respectively). Correcting inequalities in minimally invasive surgical resection resulted in reductions in total hospital stay of 1567 days, 975 days, 912 days, and 682 days following the corrective scenarios on age, deprivation, comorbidity, and frailty, respectively, and reductions in 1-year mortality for the whole cohort.\nCorrecting inequalities in implementation of minimally invasive surgical resection has the potential to reduce inequalities in colon cancer outcomes.\nCancer Research UK.",

    "title": "Evaluation of progression-free status at 24 months as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival in patients with human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancer: a retrospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "There is minimal evidence supporting the use of early clinical endpoints to evaluate the activity of initial treatment in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer in the context of contemporary therapeutic approaches. The aim of this study was to assess progression-free status at 24 months as a potential surrogate endpoint for overall survival at the patient level, within a large, retrospective cohort of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer.\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included all consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer who underwent radiotherapy (dose \u226550 Gy [relative biological effectiveness]) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA). Post-radiotherapy follow-up consisted of a clinical evaluation 8-12 weeks after treatment, then surveillance every 3 months for 2 years and every 6-12 months thereafter, incorporating imaging and physical examination to assess response and detect disease recurrence. The primary dichotomous outcome was progression-free status at 24 months after initiating radiotherapy. Overall survival outcomes were compared with those of age-matched, sex-matched, and calendar year-matched general populations sourced from US Life Tables, using expected survival estimates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs).\nBetween Jan 11, 2013, and Dec 27, 2022, 1245 patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy were included in the analysis (median age 61 years [IQR 55-68]; 1093 [87\u00b78%] male patients and 152 [12\u00b72%] female patients). Median follow-up from the start of radiotherapy was 63\u00b73 months (IQR 40\u00b74-91\u00b73). 5-year overall survival was 89\u00b73% (95% CI 87\u00b74-91\u00b72). 1183 patients had follow-up data for 24-month progression-free status assessment with 1044 (88\u00b73%) progression-free at 24 months after initiating radiotherapy. The SMR after reaching 24-month progression-free status was 1\u00b72 (95% CI 1\u00b70-1\u00b76; p=0\u00b7090). The 5-year subsequent overall survival of patients who reached 24-month progression-free status was 93\u00b71% (95% CI 91\u00b71-95\u00b71), similar to the expected 5-year overall survival of 92\u00b77% in the matched US general population. In patients with disease progression within 24 months, 5-year subsequent overall survival was 33\u00b75% (25\u00b74-44\u00b72), versus an expected 5-year overall survival of 91\u00b71% in the matched US general population, with a corresponding SMR of 17\u00b79 (14\u00b73-22\u00b72; p<0\u00b70001).\nProgression-free status at 24 months was a strong prognostic marker for overall survival at the patient level in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer and future trial-level analysis is now warranted. The adoption of this endpoint has the potential to accelerate therapeutic development by enabling earlier evaluation of treatment activity, thereby facilitating the timely introduction of novel therapies to this patient population before the availability of mature overall survival data.\nThis research was funded in part through the US National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant P30 CA008748.",

    "title": "Metastasis-directed therapy and standard of care versus standard of care for oligometastatic prostate cancer (WOLVERINE): a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis from the X-MET collaboration.",
    "abstract": "Oligometastatic disease represents the proximal end of a metastatic spectrum. Metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) is increasingly used to treat oligometastatic disease despite the absence of level 1 evidence. We amalgamated individual patient data across trials to evaluate the effectiveness of MDT for oligometastatic prostate cancer.\nWe conducted a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis. We systematically searched Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify randomised trials of MDT enrolling patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Inclusion criteria were published randomised prospective trials enrolling patients with oligometastatic (up to five metastases) prostate cancer, in which investigators recorded sufficient data to evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival. This systematic review was conducted from database creation to Nov 3, 2023, and was updated on May 4, 2025. Data appraisal was conducted using Covidence with two investigators (CT and ADS) performing independent screens. Studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias assessment (version 2.0). Individual patient data were provided by investigators. Coprimary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival. Secondary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and castration resistance-free survival. The primary analysis was conducted in the subset of studies in which patients were randomly assigned to MDT plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC. The primary analysis included a trial-level analysis using a random effects model and a patient-level analysis stratifying by trial. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023479078).\nOf 2975 studies identified for screening, seven phase 2 studies randomly assigning 574 men were included. Six trials randomly assigning 472 patients to MDT plus SOC (n=248) versus SOC (n=224) were used to evaluate MDT and had a median follow-up time of 40\u00b77 months (IQR 25\u00b76-53\u00b77). MDT was associated with improved progression-free survival (trial-level hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b744, [95% CI 0\u00b735-0\u00b756], p<0\u00b70001; patient-level HR 0\u00b745 [0\u00b735-0\u00b757], p<0\u00b70001), radiographic progression-free survival (trial-level HR 0\u00b760 [0\u00b742-0\u00b785], p=0\u00b70039; patient-level HR 0\u00b759 [0\u00b746-0\u00b776], p<0\u00b70001), and castration resistance-free survival (trial-level HR 0\u00b758 [95% CI 0\u00b737-0\u00b792], p=0\u00b7019; patient-level HR 0\u00b758 [95% CI 0\u00b737-0\u00b791], p=0\u00b7017). The association between MDT and overall survival showed an HR of 0\u00b763 (95% CI 0\u00b739-1\u00b700, p=0\u00b7051) in trial-level analyses and 0\u00b764 (95% CI 0\u00b740-1\u00b701, p=0\u00b7057) in patient-level analyses.\nWOLVERINE showed a benefit with MDT for oligometastatic prostate cancer in progression-free survival, radiological progression-free survival, and castration resistance-free survival. Overall survival benefit was not significant and further research is needed.\nPhilanthropic gift and National Cancer Institute.",

    "title": "High-throughput analyses of a reconstituted diversity-generating retroelement identify intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of diversification.",
    "abstract": "Diversity-Generating Retroelements (DGRs) are specialized genetic systems typically harnessed in nature to evolve new molecular recognition. This mechanism, known as mutagenic retrohoming, relies on an error-prone reverse transcriptase (bRT) that introduces errors at template adenines, followed by the incorporation of the resulting mutagenized complementary DNA (cDNA) into a homologous target gene. Although widely distributed, DGRs are conspicuously absent from key bacterial models, limiting our understanding of their functionality in these hosts and their potential as engineering tools. Here, we demonstrate the 'plug-and-play' nature of the Bordetella phage BPP-1 DGR by successfully reconstituting the mutagenic retrohoming mechanism in Escherichia coli. Using high-throughput tools available in this tractable bacterium, we identified key regulatory factors that allowed us to enhance DGR efficiency over 1000-fold. Systematic analysis defines how sequence context governs bRT's fidelity, uncovering a distinct error profile for the AAC motifs prevalent in natural DGR templates. This intrinsic bias prioritizes the sampling of residues essential for antigen recognition, effectively focusing the evolutionary search within the most productive regions of sequence space. Furthermore, a transposon sequencing screen identified the single-stranded DNA exonuclease ExoI as an inhibitor of DGR activity. While removing ExoI enhanced activity by more than ten-fold, we found that its nuclease activity was dispensable for this inhibition, suggesting a non-catalytic mechanism. Finally, a genome-scale survey highlighted enhanced DGR efficiency at targets located near the replication origin and oriented outwardly from it. This bias is clearly linked to replication directionality, suggesting that certain aspects of DNA replication cycles promote mutagenic retrohoming. Collectively, our work reveals previously unappreciated mechanistic features of DGRs and establishes this reconstituted system as a powerful platform for targeted gene diversification and clarifying the molecular mechanism of mutagenic retrohoming.",

    "abstract": "Bargaining is a fundamental social behavior in which individuals often accept unfair offers. Traditional behavioral models, based solely on choice data, typically interpret such acceptance as simple reward-maximization. However, regulating inequity aversion may also play a critical role in these decisions. Incorporating response time alongside choice data allows us to quantify participants' internal mental effort when deciding to accept unfair offers. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants played the ultimatum game, deciding within 10\u2009s whether to accept or reject monetary offers from a proposer. Using the drift diffusion model (DDM), we quantified decision-making dynamics based on both choice and response time. Participants with lower levels of behavioral disadvantageous inequity (DI) aversion (reflected by a lower DDM weight for DI) showed stronger neural representations of DI in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Functional connectivity analysis revealed a negative correlation between the dACC and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) when DI was high. This connectivity predicted both rejection rates and response times associated with the acceptance of DI offers. Furthermore, robust linear regression showed that only dACC-vlPFC connectivity-not reward-related activity-explained both the rejection rates and response times. Finally, right vlPFC activity correlated with amygdala activity under high DI conditions. These findings suggest that the dACC plays a key role in regulating responses to DI, thereby facilitating the acceptance of unfair offers.",

    "abstract": "The ability to anticipate rhythmic and melodic structures in music is considered a fundamental human trait, present across all cultures and predating linguistic comprehension in human development. Yet, it remains unclear the extent to which this ability is already developed at birth. Here, we used temporal response functions to assess rhythmic and melodic neural encoding in newborns (N\u2009=\u200949) exposed to classical monophonic musical pieces (real condition) and control stimuli with shuffled tones and inter-onset intervals (shuffled condition). We computationally quantified context-based rhythmic and melodic expectations and dissociated these high-level processes from low-level acoustic tracking, such as local changes in timing and pitch. We observed encoding of probabilistic rhythmic expectations only in response to real but not shuffled music. This proves newborns' ability to rely on rhythmic statistical regularities to generate musical expectations. We found no evidence for the tracking of melodic information, demonstrating a downweighting of this dimension compared to the rhythmic one. This study provides neurophysiological evidence that the capacity to track statistical regularities in music is present at birth and driven by rhythm. Melodic tracking, in contrast, may receive more weight through development with exposure to signals relevant to communication, such as speech and music.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical coupling and chemical communication between cardiomyocytes are facilitated through a specialized adhesive structure called the intercalated disc (ICD). The ICD is essential for heart organization and contraction. Yet, the network of adhesion, adaptor and signaling proteins that form the ICD remains poorly defined. Here, we combined proximity labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins associated with the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 2 (DSG2), in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. We identified over 300 proteins in the DSG2 interactome, half of which are shared with the N-cadherin (CDH2) interactome in cardiomyocytes. Proteins unique to DSG2 include connexin 43 and the plakin family of cytolinker proteins. Comparison of the cardiomyocyte DSG2 interactome with the interactomes of desmosomal proteins from epithelia revealed few shared proteins. In cardiomyocytes, plakoglobin and plakophilin 2 (PKP2) were the most abundant shared proteins between the DSG2 and CDH2 interactomes. We show that PKP2 is a dynamic protein whose membrane recruitment in cardiomyocytes is dependent on tension. Our analysis of the DSG2 interactome provides a crucial new dimension to the proteomic atlas of the essential molecular complexes required for cardiomyocyte adhesion.",

    "abstract": "Lipid membranes form the essential barriers that compartmentalize life, separating intracellular processes from the external environment. To maintain cellular function and viability, both the plasma membrane and internal organelle membranes undergo continuous compositional and functional remodeling in response to environmental fluctuations. Traditionally, glycerophospholipids have been primarily considered structural components of these membranes. However, their dynamic synthesis plays a crucial role in modulating membrane functions and, consequently, cellular adaptability. This Review discusses how cells orchestrate complex glycerophospholipid metabolism to adapt to diverse environmental challenges. By examining membrane adaptation to various changes, including temperature shifts, pH imbalances and nutrient availability, we propose that responsive alterations in glycerophospholipid synthesis act as a central metabolic hub. This hub influences overall cellular metabolism and regulatory networks. This Review highlights an often overlooked aspect of lipid biology: the pivotal role of glycerophospholipid metabolism in modulating cellular adaptability and resilience.",

This Review provides an update on recent developments in biofluid-based biomarkers for amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathology, tau pathology, neurodegeneration, glial reactivity, \u03b1-synuclein pathology, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, synaptic pathophysiology and cerebrovascular disease-pathologies and processes that are all relevant to neurodegenerative dementias. Complementing longstanding cerebrospinal assays, improved technologies now facilitate the detection of molecules linked to neurodegenerative brain changes at very low concentrations in the blood. This promises to complement the clinical evaluation of suspected neurodegenerative disease in healthcare with molecular phenotyping biomarkers that will help to link the clinical symptoms to ongoing pathophysiological processes in the brain and improve how patients are referred to specialty clinics for initiation and monitoring of molecularly targeted treatments. Clinically relevant breakthroughs such as the use of anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies to address A\u03b2 pathology in AD serve as important proof-of-concept examples of how the field is advancing toward molecularly informed prevention and treatment.

    "abstract": "The vaginal microbiota is associated with the health of women and newborns alike. Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort. The insights gleaned from this study shed light on potential pathways for BV prevention and treatment.",

It has been well established that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr induces constitutive DDR signaling and G2/M cell cycle arrest, but the virologic function of this activity remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of functional, pharmacologic, biochemical, and genetic approaches to establish that virion-associated and de novo Vpr proteins induce DDR responses that trigger global epigenetic remodeling and activation of transcription programs to enhance HIV-1 promoter activity during acute infection and reactivation from latency. Functional, genetic, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments reveal that Vpr segregates into two functionally discrete pools-a multimeric pool in the nucleus associated with chromatin and a monomeric pool in the cytoplasm associated with a host E3-ubiquitin ligase. Vpr-induced DDR and epigenetic remodeling activities are present in common HIV-1 subtypes circulating globally and in patient-derived isolates.",

Nevertheless, the research on the neural conduction mechanism of oviposition is still rather limited in most agricultural pests. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved Kainate receptors (KARs) expressed in the glutamatergic neurons (GNs) and the ovipositor neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) regulate the oviposition behavior in Bactrocera dorsalis. We identified two KARs (Grik2b and Grik2c), which control the oviposition behavior by influencing both oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Protein-ligand interaction indicated that glutamate serves as the neurotransmitter of Grik2b and Grik2c. Knockdown glutamate-coding genes adversely impacted oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Specific knockdown Grik2b (or Grik2c) in the GNs and NMJs could respectively influence oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Finally, inhibitors of KARs were screened for their ability to inhibit oviposition. Our study provides strong supporting evidence that a novel neural conduction mechanism for oviposition by uncovering the diverse roles of KARs and provides potential molecular target controlling insect oviposition.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat emerging through microbe adaptation, driven by genetic variation, genome plasticity or epigenetic processes. In this study, we investigated how the Mucor circinelloides species complex adapts to the antifungal natural product FK506, which binds to FKBP12 and inhibits calcineurin-dependent hyphal growth. In Mucor bainieri, most FK506-resistant isolates (90%) were found to be unstable and transient, readily reverting to being drug sensitive when passaged without drug, and with no associated DNA mutations. In half of the isolates (50%), FK506-resistance was conferred by RNAi-dependent epimutation in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silenced the fkbA encoding FKBP12 post-transcriptionally. In contrast, most of the remaining FK506-resistant isolates (40%) were found to have undergone heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 dimethylation, transcriptionally repressing fkbA and neighboring genes. In these heterochromatic epimutants, only minimal enrichment of siRNA to the fkbA locus was observed, but in three of the four examples, siRNA was significantly enriched at a locus distant from fkbA. A similar mechanism operates in Mucor atramentarius, where FK506 resistance was mediated by ectopic heterochromatin silencing of fkbA and associated genes with siRNA spreading across the region. Heterochromatin-mediated fkbA epimutants exhibited stability during in vivo infection, suggesting epimutation could impact pathogenesis. These findings reveal that antifungal resistance arising through distinct, transient epimutation pathways involving RNAi or heterochromatin, highlighting adaptive AMR strategies employed by ubiquitous eukaryotic microbes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the human brain encodes visual objects involves deciphering the neural computations and circuits in the temporal lobe. Here, we recorded intracranial EEG from the human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL), as well as single-neuron activity in the MTL, to investigate the computational mechanisms of neural object coding. The VTC exhibited axis-based feature coding, and a neural feature space could be constructed using VTC neural axes, within which visual objects clustered according to high-level categorical relationships. Importantly, MTL neurons encoded receptive fields within this VTC neural feature space, exhibiting selective responses to objects that shared perceptual and conceptual similarities. This computational framework, therefore, explains how dense, feature-based representations in the VTC are transformed into sparse, high-level representations in the MTL. We further validated our findings using an additional dataset with different stimuli. Notably, we uncovered the physiological basis of this computational framework by demonstrating VTC-MTL interactions at multiple levels. Together, our neural computational framework provides a mechanistic understanding of the neural processes underlying object recognition.",

This study uncovers the pivotal role of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness in driving ATC aggressiveness through mechanotransduction mediated by the Integrin \u03b16\u03b24/Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) axis. By engineering collagen-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels with tunable rigidity, we demonstrated that high ECM stiffness (60\u2009kPa) markedly enhanced ATC cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, stiff matrices induced cytoskeletal reorganization, activated RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42 signaling, and upregulated Integrin \u03b16\u03b24-FAK pathway components, as validated by transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional assays. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK reversed stiffness-dependent tumor-promoting effects in vitro. In vivo, mice injected with tumor cells pre-cultured on high-stiffness ECM-mimicking hydrogels exhibited accelerated subcutaneous tumor growth and increased lung metastatic burden, which were significantly attenuated by FAK-targeted therapy. These findings establish ECM stiffness as a biomechanical determinant of ATC progression and metastasis, offering novel insights into microenvironment-driven malignancy and highlighting FAK as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt mechanosignaling in ATC.",

    "abstract": "Capecitabine has been commonly used for the treatment of early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients; however, the resistance limits its curative potential. Here, we perform multi-omics data analysis and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of biological samples from patients in the CBCSG010 clinical trial who were randomized to receive adjuvant docetaxel-anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without capecitabine. We find that patients with a better prognosis in the capecitabine group exhibited an immune-inflamed microenvironment and upregulation of interferon pathways. Moreover, we identify interferon-related TANK-binding kinase 1-binding protein 1 (TBKBP1) as the key gene involved in capecitabine resistance. We uncover that TBKBP1 promotes capecitabine resistance through impairment of activated immune cells infiltration in vivo. Mechanistically, TBKBP1 negatively regulates type I interferon pathway activated by capecitabine treatment, by promoting autophagy-mediated protein degradation of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1). In summary, our study implicates TBKBP1 in mediating capecitabine resistance and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of TNBC.",

ACR is mediated by the recycler complex, powered by dynein-dynactin complexes, and regulated by RAB32-family small GTPases. However, it remains unknown whether ACR is subject to nutrient signal regulation or whether additional molecular components participate in the recycler complex. Our latest research identifies SNX16 as a new component of the recycler complex and reveals that MTORC1 phosphorylates SNX16, enabling SNX16 to function as a nutrient sensor that regulates ACR.",

    "abstract": "Histones scaffold genomic DNA and regulate access to the transcriptional machinery. However, naturally occurring histone variants can alter histone-DNA interactions, DNA and histone modifications, and the chromatin interactome. Hence, alterations in histone variant deposition can disrupt chromatin, and are increasingly recognized as a way to trigger various disease, including cancer. While significant attention has been placed on the biochemical and functional roles of H2A, H3, and H4 histone variants, the variants of H2B remain largely understudied. Here, we show that H2B variants are dysregulated in breast cancer and that certain variants are associated with specific breast cancer subtypes. HIST1H2BO overexpression (in particular) is more common in Asian, African American/Black, and young female populations and is associated with a worse prognosis. In vitro studies show that H2B1O compacts nucleosome structure. Incorporating H2B1O into chromatin activates pro-inflammatory and oncogenic pathways, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and generates resistance to first-line chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, H2B1O acts much like an onco-histone, with H2B variant expression being a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer and a potential new target for drug therapies to enhance treatment efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is the standard for provider-based rating of adverse events in oncology, but its reliability for symptomatic adverse events is low. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data might improve the inter-rater reliability of CTCAE assessments. We investigated whether providers' access to PRO data enhances the inter-rater reliability of CTCAE ratings and the detection of symptomatic adverse events.\nThis multinational, open-label, randomised controlled trial was done in 11 hospitals in ten countries. Adults (aged \u226518 years) with any cancer diagnosis receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy of curative or palliative intent were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention group (in which providers saw patients' PRO data as they were doing CTCAE assessments) or the control group (in which providers did not have access to PRO data) within each centre through a minimisation algorithm and a weighted cutoff; no additional stratification factors were applied. Patients completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and 16 additional items from the EORTC Item Library, covering 17 symptomatic adverse events. Two independent providers (oncologists or trained nurses) did CTCAE ratings. The primary endpoint was the inter-rater reliability of CTCAE ratings, expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), for all patients with complete assessments. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04066868) and is now closed.\nBetween Feb 10, 2020, and Dec 6, 2024, a total of 1067 patients were enrolled (538 in the control group and 529 in the intervention group), with full data from 512 patients in the control group and 501 in the intervention group included in the analysis. Median age was 59 years (IQR 46-68); 558 (55\u00b71%) of 1013 were female and 455 (44\u00b79%) were male. Most had good functional status (403 [79%] of 512 had ECOG 0-1 in the control group and 371 [74%] of 501 in the intervention group). The most common cancer types were haematological (control group: 137 [27%] of 512; intervention group: 131 [26%] of 501), breast (control group: 118 [23%]; intervention group: 107 [21%]), and gastrointestinal (control group: 98 [19%]; intervention group: 89 [18%]). Inter-rater reliability was significantly higher in the intervention group for 13 of 17 symptomatic adverse events, with the largest differences for memory impairment (ICC 0\u00b7176; p<0\u00b70001), irritability (0\u00b7161; p<0\u00b70001), concentration impairment (0\u00b7157; p<0\u00b70001), depression (0\u00b7126; p=0\u00b70012), and anxiety (0\u00b7109; p=0\u00b70018). There was no significant difference for pain, rash, and peripheral sensory neuropathy and the reliability was significantly higher in the control group than the intervention group for diarrhoea (ICC -0\u00b7066; p=0\u00b7013).\nAvailability of PRO data to providers for CTCAE rating improves the consistency of provider-based symptomatic adverse event detection in patients with cancer. PRO data supports reliable assessment of treatment-related toxicity, highlighting the value of integrating PRO data into clinical evaluations within cancer trials.\nEORTC Quality of Life Group.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy resistance remains a critical barrier in cancer treatment, partly driven by polyploid cells that survive therapy and contribute to tumor recurrence. Here, we investigated epigenomic and transcriptional changes associated with cisplatin-surviving polyploid cells compared to parental cancer cells in prostate cancer (PC3) and triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines. We observed persistent dysregulation of chromatin compaction and altered nuclear structure in polyploid cells following cisplatin treatment. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling via ATAC-seq revealed significant remodeling, notably decreased promoter accessibility at proliferation-associated loci and increased accessibility of distal regulatory elements linked to inflammation and stress response. RNA-seq analyses demonstrated a coordinated transcriptional shift away from proliferative signatures toward inflammatory and survival pathways, including activation of NF\u03baB, interferon response, and integrated stress response pathways. Importantly, we identified subsets of genes showing concordant changes in promoter accessibility and transcriptional activity, directly linking chromatin remodeling to transcriptional reprogramming. These integrated findings highlight the role of chromatin dynamics and epigenetic plasticity in chemotherapy resistance, demonstrating that widespread chromatin accessibility changes facilitate the transition to a stress-adapted, polyploid cell state. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms supporting cancer cell persistence after chemotherapy.",

In our recent study, we identified C3orf33/CG30159/MISO as a conserved regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and stress-induced subdomain formation in ",

    "abstract": "The prognosis for patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas remains poor. Evidence shows that a combination of antiangiogenic agents and chemotherapy inhibit tumour growth. We aimed to investigate the dual targeting of VEGF and MET pathways with cabozantinib and temozolomide in patients with unresectable or metastatic leiomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas.\nThis multicentre, single-arm, lead-in phase 2 trial was conducted at five academic Sarcoma Centers of Excellence of the Midwest Sarcoma Trials Partnership in the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had histologically-confirmed unresectable or metastatic uterine and non-uterine leiomyosarcoma (cohort 1) and other soft tissue sarcomas (cohort 2; exploratory), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, up to five previous chemotherapy regimens, adequate organ and bone marrow function, and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1). Patients received oral cabozantinib 40 mg (as a starting dose) once per day and temozolomide 150 mg/m\nBetween Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 6, 2023, 96 patients were assessed for eligibility, 24 were ineligible, and 72 were enrolled. The median age at enrolment was 59 years (IQR 52-66) in cohort 1 (n=42) and 63 years (50-69) in cohort 2 (n=30), with a median follow-up of 18\u00b70 months (17\u00b75-20\u00b77). 42 (58%) of 72 patients were female and 30 (42%) were male. In cohort 1, progression-free survival at 12 weeks was reached by 31 (74%) of 42 patients who were still receiving cabozantinib and temozolomide. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression-free survival was higher due to censoring and not requiring patients to be receiving treatment at 12 weeks (79\u00b74% [95% CI 68\u00b76-86\u00b78]). 20 (48%) patients in cohort 1 and 23 (77%) in cohort 2 had died due to disease progression at the end of the study. 71 (99%) of 72 patients had grade 1 or higher treatment-related adverse events. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events attributed to either one or both drugs were platelet count decrease (22 [30%]), neutrophil count decrease (13 [18%]), hypertension (seven [10%]), and diarrhoea (six [8%]). There were no treatment-related deaths.\nCabozantinib with temozolomide showed a meaningful clinical benefit and could potentially be a viable treatment option for patients with unresectable or metastatic leiomyosarcoma. Treatment was tolerable and did not reveal any new safety signals.\nExelixis.",

    "abstract": "Combined targeting of angiogenic and immune pathways is an emerging strategy in clear cell carcinomas arising from the gynaecological tract (CCGCs), given the unique molecular and microenvironmental features of this gynaecological cancer. We aimed to evaluate the preliminary activity and safety of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib in patients with recurrent CCGC.\nWe conducted a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial (LARA) across three tertiary hospitals in Singapore and South Korea. Adult patients (aged \u226518 years) with histologically confirmed CCGC, which had progressed or recurred after at least one previous line of platinum-based chemotherapy; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-1; and no previous exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients received 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks plus 20 mg oral lenvatinib daily, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first, for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was objective response rate in the first 24 weeks of treatment, as per investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST; version 1.1), analysed by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04699071) and is ongoing.\nBetween March 26, 2021, and Oct 10, 2023, 30 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 27 (90%) participants received at least one dose of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib. 25 (83%) patients were included in the primary outcome analysis. Median participant age was 52 years (IQR 40-66). Among the 27 patients, 12 (44%) were Chinese, 12 (44%) were Korean, two (7%) were Malay, and one (4%) was Filipino. 24 (89%) patients had primary ovarian clear cell carcinoma; three (11%) had primary endometrial cancer. All tumours had proficient mismatch repair or microsatellite stability. At data cutoff on March 19, 2025, median follow-up was 21\u00b70 months (IQR 12\u00b75-25\u00b72). Ten of 25 patients had confirmed objective response within 24 weeks (objective response rate at 24 weeks 40% [95% CI 21-61]). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (52%) of 27 patients, the most common of which were hypertension (six [22%] patients), decreased platelet count (two [7%]), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST; two [7%]), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT; two [7%]). Serious adverse events occurred in five (19%) patients, the most common of which were immune-related hepatitis in two (7%) patients and decreased platelet count in two (7%) patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred.\nPembrolizumab plus lenvatinib showed promising anti-tumour activity and manageable safety in patients with recurrent CCGC, including in patients with disease progression following previous treatment with anti-angiogenic therapy. These findings support further evaluation of this combination in randomised controlled trials.\nNational Medical Research Council (Singapore), Pangestu Family Foundation Gynaecological Cancer Research Fund, and MSD.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) patients is an aggressive bone cancer with limited treatment options. Dysregulation of the CDK4/6-cycling D axis and the PI3K/mTOR pathway contributes to OS pathogenesis, providing a biological rationale for co-targeting these signaling nodes. However, pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibition can trigger compensatory activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, restoring D-type cycling expression and partially reactivating CDK4/6 signaling. Thus, dual inhibition of the CDK4/6 and PI3K/mTOR pathways not only addresses two parallel oncogenic drivers but may also prevent potential CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance mediated by feedback activation of PI3K/mTOR. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that coordinated targeting of these pathways would improve tumor control in preclinical OS models. In vitro sensitivity analyses using palbociclib and voxtalisib demonstrated additive to synergistic OS growth suppression, with palbociclib inducing G1 arrest and senescence, and the combination enhancing autophagy. Furthermore, the efficacy, tolerability, and mechanisms of palbociclib and voxtalisib, alone or in combination, were evaluated in molecularly defined primary treatment-na\u00efve, and relapsed/metastatic OS models. In the relapsed/metastatic PDX77-TT2 model, short-term palbociclib exposure activated PI3K/mTOR signaling, whereas the combination of palbociclib and voxtalisib in long-term studies produced marked tumor suppression and extended survival. In the primary treatment-na\u00efve PDX96 model, long-term palbociclib exposure generated a robust CDK4/6 pharmacodynamic response. The addition of voxtalisib reinforced autophagy, sustained CDK pathway inhibition, and improved overall tumor control. In an OS lung-colonization model, CDK4/6 inhibition alone markedly reduced OS lung nodules, with combination therapy providing comparable suppression. Dual CDK4/6-PI3K/mTOR inhibition achieves tumor control across various OS models, supporting the use of genomically guided, pathway-targeted strategies for pediatric and AYA OS.",

    "abstract": "Patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly those with EGFR mutations, face a high risk of recurrence and mortality post-surgery. Aumolertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, is approved in China for adjuvant treatment in patients with NSCLC harbouring EGFR with an exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation. The ARTS study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant therapy with aumolertinib in patients with stage II-IIIB EGFR-mutated NSCLC.\nThis double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial enrolled patients from 48 hospitals in mainland China. Eligible patients were 18 years or older with stage II-IIIB NSCLC, had undergone a complete resection followed by standard adjuvant therapy, and had an EGFR ex19del or Leu858Arg mutation and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1. Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation status and tumour stage and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive aumolertinib 110 mg or placebo orally, once daily for 3 years or until disease recurrence or other discontinuation criteria were met. Patients were randomly allocated to groups using an interactive web response system; the double\u2011dummy technique masked patients, investigators, and assessors. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the modified intention-to treat (mITT) population (ie, all patients with stage II-IIIB NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations who had undergone complete tumour resection and standard adjuvant therapy), assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Although the study is ongoing, with some patients remaining in follow-up, this analysis represents the protocol-specified primary analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04687241).\nBetween April 30, 2021, and May 17, 2022, 399 individuals were screened for study eligibility; of these, 214 patients were randomly assigned to receive aumolertinib or placebo (107 in each group). 120 (56%) patients were female, 94 (44%) were male, median age was 59 years (IQR 54-66), and all patients were Chinese. 204 (95%) of 214 patients had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient in the aumolertinib group and three patients in the placebo group had stage I disease; therefore, 106 patients in the aumolertinib group and 104 in the placebo group were included in the mITT (primary analysis) population. As of the data cutoff date (April 15, 2024), the median duration of follow-up was 27\u00b756 months (IQR 22\u00b718-27\u00b770) in the aumolertinib group and 27\u00b763 months (22\u00b718-27\u00b779) in the placebo group. The BICR-assessed disease-free survival was significantly improved in the aumolertinib group compared with the placebo group, with an HR of 0\u00b717 (95% CI 0\u00b709-0\u00b729, p<0\u00b70001). The median disease-free survival per BICR in the aumolertinib group was not reached (95% CI 29\u00b714 to not applicable), whereas it was 19\u00b742 months (11\u00b724-26\u00b722) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the aumolertinib group versus the placebo group were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (seven [7%] vs none), prolonged electrocardiogram QT interval (three [3%] vs three [3%]), hypertension (one [1%] vs five [5%]), and pneumonia (two [2%] vs three [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in one (1%) patient receiving aumolertinib and three (3%) patients receiving placebo. No treatment-related deaths occurred and no new safety signals were identified for aumolertinib.\nAumolertinib showed substantial clinical benefits as adjuvant therapy in Chinese patients with stage II-IIIB EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer, among the most prevalent cancer types globally, exhibits marked heterogeneity and varying disease progression and clinical outcomes. Improved molecular subtyping is needed for patient stratification. Since prostate cancer has relatively few somatic point mutations, whole-transcriptome data instead offers a rich and relevant source of molecular data. We analyzed bulk tissue transcriptomes from four cohorts to characterize primary prostate cancer's cell type composition. A deconvolution of cell types was performed based on gene expression profiles. Patients with available multi-sample regional data from different tumor foci were analyzed for intrapatient heterogeneity. Three cell type composition subtypes were defined: T cells enriched (TCE), epithelial cells enriched (EPCE), and tumor-associated stromal cells enriched (TASCE). A machine learning model was developed to classify these subtypes and validated in three independent cohorts. The subtyping demonstrated a high correlation with established clinicopathological parameters (e.g., Gleason score, p-value < 0.05), and the classifier showed a promising ability to predict biochemical recurrence. Moreover, our analysis revealed that interfocal heterogeneity in patients with multifocal cancer significantly surpassed intrafocal heterogeneity (p-value < 0.05). In conclusion, this study provides a novel prostate cancer subgrouping based on cell type composition, with the TASCE subtype significantly associated with high biochemical recurrence risk.",

We report updated overall survival and longer-term efficacy and safety outcomes.\nCARTITUDE-4 is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial at 81 hospital sites in the USA, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Eligible patients were adults (aged >18 years) with lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma, with one to three previous treatment lines, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. After the trial started, the threshold defining measurable disease was lowered to 0\u00b75 g/dL from 1\u00b70 g/dL serum monoclonal paraprotein on July 2, 2021, to increase trial access.

Focusing on epithelial precancers, this review first defines the metastable state and signalling networks that distinguish precancer from homeostasis and cancer. It then examines the models and technologies used to investigate PME signalling across spatial-temporal dimensions, followed by an integrated overview of how PME components collectively shape lesion trajectories.

While preclinical research has identified multiple potential vulnerabilities in BAP1-deficient tumors-including sensitivity to EZH2-, HDAC-, PARP-, and FGFR-inhibitors-translating these findings to the clinic remains a challenge.

However, its involvement in cisplatin (CDDP) resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that histone lactylation is closely associated with CDDP resistance and correlates with poor prognosis of NSCLC. Mechanistically, H4K12la (histone e 4 lysine 12 lactylation) levels and CEBPB (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta) had a cooperative effect on the regulation of AKR1C2 (Aldo-Keto reductase 1C2). Furthermore, AKR1C2 knockdown activates the mTOR oncogenic signaling pathway. Importantly, genetic manipulation of AKR1C2 or the combination of CDDP with an mTOR inhibitor effectively reverse CDDP resistance in NSCLC/CDDP cells. These findings highlighted the potential of AKR1C2 as a predictive biomarker for patient response to CDDP therapy. Additionally, our study established a novel link between histone lactylation and CDDP resistance, providing new insights into the epigenetic regulation in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is the enzymatic subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). It catalyzes H3K27 methylation for epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors and critically drives prostate cancer (PCa) progression. However, inhibitors of EZH2 catalytic function (EZH2i), such as EPZ-6438, showed limited efficacy in PCa. Here, we designed and developed a series of VHL-based proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders of EZH2 using EPZ-6438 as a ligand and identified PROTAC-6272 as a lead compound. PROTAC-6272 effectively degraded EZH2 and other PRC2 subunits across diverse PCa cell lines. However, PROTAC-6272 and other similar EZH2i-based PROTACs were consistently unable to decrease androgen receptor (AR), a gene that is directly activated by solo EZH2. Mechanistically, EZH2 PROTACs failed to degrade EZH2 coactivators, such as p300, due to their inability to engage EZH2 outside of the PRC2 complex. Nevertheless, PROTAC-6272 exhibited anti-proliferative activities superior to EPZ-6438 in some PCa models, wherein it induced p21 expression and cellular senescence by disrupting a methylation-independent PRC2 function. In summary, while EZH2i-based PROTACs failed to target the PRC2-independent functions of EZH2, they confer added benefits over EPZ-6438 by abolishing a polycomb-dependent but methylation-independent function of EZH2, offering therapeutic advantages in some PCa.",

    "abstract": "Bone tumors are rare but highly aggressive malignancies associated with considerable mortality. Emerging evidence identifies obesity as a contributor to multiple malignancies, including those of osseous origin, primarily through mechanisms involving endocrine imbalance and chronic inflammation. Conventional obesity metrics, like body mass index (BMI), cannot reflect the full spectrum of obesity-related risks. In contrast, the age-adjusted visceral adiposity index (AVAI) offers a more holistic evaluation of obesity-associated hazards.\nThis cross-sectional analysis utilized National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data collected between 2011 and 2018. After excluding participants younger than 18 years and those lacking complete information on bone tumors or AVAI, the final analytic cohort comprised 3,731 adults. The AVAI was calculated using BMI, waist circumference, age, high-density lipoprotein levels, and triglyceride levels. The presence of a bone tumor was ascertained through medical questionnaires. Logistic regression analyses were applied to evaluate the association between AVAI levels and the occurrence of bone neoplasms, after adjusting for potential confounders such as hypertension, diabetes, and other metabolic variables.\nThe prevalence of bone tumors increased with higher AVAI quartiles, reaching 4.07 % in the highest quartile (Q4). Univariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant positive association between AVAI and bone tumors (OR = 1.19, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.31, P < 0.0001). After accounting for all demographic, metabolic, and clinical covariates, higher AVAI quartiles remained strongly associated with elevated bone tumor risk, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.64 (Q2), 2.15 (Q3), and 2.81 (Q4) compared to the reference quartile (Q1).\nThe findings indicate a significant association between AVAI and the likelihood of bone tumor development, thus emphasizing the necessity of incorporating visceral adiposity into the assessment of skeletal neoplasm incidence. Future studies should focus on the underlying mechanisms and investigate potential interventions targeting obesity-related factors to mitigate the risk of bone tumors.",

    "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) play an important role in tumor progression. ecDNA hubs have been shown to be anchored by BRD4, a chromatin reader. However, the chromatin organization of ecDNA hub remains unknown. Here we show that histone 3 lysine 56 acetylation (H3K56ac) mark binds to BRD4 specifically. Knockdown of BRD4 decreased the ecDNA hub signals by the ecTag method. Knockdown of an epigenetic player (USP7), histone acetyltransferase (CBP), or histone chaperone (Asf1a) that regulates H3K56ac mark also decreased ecDNA hub signals and H3K56ac levels, supporting the role of H3K56ac in regulating ecDNA hub maintenance. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed the interactions of BRD4, USP7, Asf1a, and CBP. Analysis of ChIP-seq datasets showed that both H3K56ac and H3K27ac converged with BRD4 binding at the ecDNA-chromosome interaction sites and ecDNA itself. However, H3K56ac had a widespread enrichment with most BRD4-occupied sites compared with H3K27ac that occupied a limited subset of BRD4 peaks. These results present a framework of ecDNA hub chromatin organization that maintains ecDNA hub integrity, further providing therapeutic options that could be used to target ecDNA hubs.",

Epidemiological analyses were performed across independent cohorts to evaluate the association between CALF markers and patient outcomes.\nA myofibroblastic CALF (myCAF) subset characterized by high LOXL2 expression was consistently enriched in advanced and chemoresistant CRC samples.

Functional inhibition or genetic silencing of LOXL2 and wnt5a in calves restored chemosensitivity in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo.\nOur integrative epidemiological and experimental analyses identify LOXL2\u207a calves as a key stromal determinant of chemoresistance and poor prognosis in CRC.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults, has a median survival of 14.6 months. To identify drivers of GBM pathogenesis, we conducted a CRISPR-knockout screen, which revealed THO Complex 1 (THOC1) as a key driver. Knocking down THOC1 significantly reduced GBM cell viability across patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines, enhancing survival (p<0.01) in primary PDX models. Conversely, overexpressing THOC1 in non-cancerous neural stem cells bolstered transformation capacity, decreasing survival and causing tumor engraftment in vivo (p<0.01). Further investigation revealed THOC1's interaction with SIN3A, a histone deacetylase complex. Histone deacetylation has been previously shown to prevent the buildup of R-loops, structures that form normally during transcription but can be lethal in excess. We found that THOC1-knockdown leads to elevated R-loop levels and reduced histone deacetylation levels. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that THOC1's role in R-loop prevention primarily affects telomeres, critical regions for cell replication. We further show that THOC1-knockdown results in significantly increased telomeric R-loop levels and shortened telomeres. Ultimately, this study suggests that targeting THOC1 is a promising therapeutic strategy to disrupt the delicate R-loop landscape and undermine GBM's replicative potential. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Glioblastoma, the most aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults, relies on a delicate R-loop landscape to promote cell replication while avoiding DNA damage. Targeting THOC1 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to disrupt the delicate R-loop landscape and undermine GBM's replicative potential.",

We found that STRING is significantly amplified and upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and its elevated expression is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Mechanically, STRING depletion in RCC cells specifically triggers activation of the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP pathway and activates cleavage of Caspase-8, thereby inducing GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, which is independent of the innate immune pathway of STRING. Moreover, animal study results revealed that STRING depletion promoted infiltration of CD4",

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER)-encoding (ESR1) gene are present in up to 40% of metastatic breast cancer (BC) patients and are strongly associated with a high risk of liver metastasis (LM) formation. Using the MCF-7 BC model, we investigated whether the increased hepatic tropism of ESR1-mutated BC cells is driven by their metabolic adaptation to the liver microenvironment. Indeed, metabolomic analysis revealed elevated metabolites related to the urea cycle (UC) in LM-forming ESR1-mutated cells compared to wild-type (WT) ER-expressing cells, which failed to generate LM. The subsequent proteomic, western blotting, and qPCR analyses demonstrated a dramatic upregulation of the UC constituent, the mitochondrial ornithine/citrulline transporter SLC25A15, in liver-predilected ESR1-mutated cells relative to their WT counterpart cells. Unlike WT cells, ESR1-mutated cells readily formed spheroids and exhibited enhanced migration in liver mimicking hepatocyte-conditioned media. In addition, we employed a novel ex vivo approach where ESR1 mutated cells were seeded onto colonized fresh liver tissue-which was abolished by SLC25A15 knockout. Moreover, SLC25A15 knockout robustly reduced the ability of ESR1-mutated cells to establish LM in vivo. These findings highlight SLC25A15-mediated dysregulation of the UC as a critical driver of BC hepatic metastasis and identify SLC25A15 as a potential therapeutic target for disrupting metastatic spread of BC to the liver.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is traditionally portrayed as a DNA double-strand break repair pathway. However, emerging evidence positions RAD51, its partners BRCA1, BRCA2, and other HR factors at the core of a broader genome-maintenance network that operates by a \"prevent and protect\" strategy extending beyond repair. Here, we review how RAD51 can shield DNA from nucleolytic processing mediated by MRE11 and related nucleases, promote fork reversal, suppress replicative DNA gaps accumulation, and bind abasic sites, averting their conversion into cytotoxic intermediates. These extended functions counteract endogenous replication stress as shown in BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient contexts, where failure to prevent gaps, protect forks, and safeguard abasic DNA accelerates genomic instability. The functional impairment of HR proteins, which interface with base-excision repair and translesion synthesis, rewires these pathways, driving distinctive base-substitution mutational signatures of HR-defective tumors. Abasic sites, especially from methyl-cytosine metabolism, put replication forks at risk of breaking, amplifying the need for RAD51-mediated defense. Such redefinition of homologous recombination protein function as part of an anticipatory surveillance and protective system, rather than a repair-only module, bears important implications for understanding tumorigenesis, therapy resistance, and aging.",

    "abstract": "The architecture of actin networks at the cell surface is regulated by local membrane topology. However, how actin nucleation can respond sensitively to the degree of membrane curvature remains incompletely understood. Using nanolithography to precisely control local membrane curvature, we reconstituted the dynamic interplay of the tri-component Cdc42/FBP17/N-WASP system on a series of deformed membrane sites, resulting in differential actin nucleation. We found that high-curvature sensing is primarily mediated by FBP17 through its intrinsic BAR-domain activity, which then induces the hierarchical assembly of FBP17/N-WASP clusters to activate N-WASP in synergy with Cdc42. This nucleation boost is fine-tuned by modulating the FBP17-to-N-WASP stoichiometry within multivalent macromolecular assemblies according to local curvature radii. At lower-curvature regions, Cdc42 enhances basal FBP17 recruitment to the membrane, enabling detection of shallow curvatures and initiating actin polymerization before high-curvature effects dominate. This establishes a dynamic, curvature radius-dependent cooperativity that links geometric cues to the regulation of actin polymerization, highlighting their interplay in coordinating membrane and actin morphodynamics during complex cellular processes.",

Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of different stress models and observed that co-induced genes are generally located in close genomic proximity. By integrating gene expression and transcription factor binding resources across different stress models, we identify an enrichment for clusters in which only one of the clusters' promoters recruits the key transcription factors, reminiscent of Epromoters-a type of cis-regulatory element that displays both promoter and enhancer function. Epromoter-regulated clusters were frequently found regardless of the stress or inflammatory response. Predicted Epromoters displayed enhancer activity and regulated clusters of stress-response genes independently of their genomic location. These findings imply that Epromoters are central regulatory elements that control gene clusters in response to acute perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRPs) protect bacterial DNA gyrase from quinolone antibiotics. While some secreted PRPs are essential upon quinolone exposure, their role in the regulation of antibiotic resistance remains to be fully characterized. We show that a YjbI-type secreted PRP regulates antibiotic sensitivity, bimodally for small or large molecules, via modulation of the Caulobacter crescentus outer membrane (OM). YjbI silences two converging envelope-stress pathways that globally reprogram the OM proteome via TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs), periplasmic proteases, and AcrAB-NodT, a multidrug efflux pump whose induction by small molecules and antibiotics is lethal to yjbI mutant cells. Loss of YjbI also confers sensitivity to vancomycin and bacitracin, two large peptidoglycan-targeting and zinc-binding antibiotics that permeate the outer membrane via the previously uncharacterized TBDR BugA and its orthologs. Zinc stress triggers rapid proteolytic removal of Yjbl, activates expression of TBDRs, including BugA, and ultimately leads to replenishment of YjbI. Molecular dynamics simulations and reactive thiol probing imply an asymmetric surface disposition of YjbI, explaining the differential accessibility of its conserved cysteine pairs that flank the quadrilateral \u03b2-helix. Taken together, our findings identify a role of YjbI as a cell surface-regulator of outer membrane composition and antibiotic sensitivity in a Gram-negative bacterium.",

    "abstract": "Despite being evolutionary distant, plants and animals exhibit a shared phenomenon during the transition from somatic-to-reproductive cell fate marked by extensive structural and compositional changes in chromatin. This chromatin reprogramming occurs in the plant SMCs (Spore Mother Cells) and animal PGCs (primordial germ cells) and is initiated by the loss of linker histones (H1). H1 loss is essential to establish pluripotency in animal PGCs but its role is not known in plants. Here, we identified two regulatory pathways involving a citrullinase and an E3-ubiquitin ligase that contribute H1.1 loss in female SMCs in Arabidopsis. We also identified roles for two specific residues: an arginine, whose positive charge contributes to H1.1 destabilization from chromatin, and a lysine in the globular domain that is essential for H1.1 degradation. Ovules with impaired H1.1 loss in the SMC proceed through sporogenesis but fail to complete gametogenesis. We propose that a citrullination-ubiquitination pathway governs pre-meiotic H1 depletion as a critical mechanism for establishing post-meiotic competence in the Arabidopsis germline.",

Structural analysis and activity assays confirm that ribociclib binds the CaMKII active site and inhibits its activity. We further customize SidBait to identify protein-protein interactions and discover the F-actin capping protein (CapZ) as a target of the Legionella effector RavB during infection.

Here, we generated the first single-nucleotide resolution map of m\u2076A in planarians, and revealed that simple sequence rules guide m\u2076A deposition, facilitating the flexible evolutionary gain and loss of these marks. Functional analyses of the five YTHDF planarian m\u2076A readers revealed that while individual reader expression is dispensable, together, the planarian YTHDF proteins regulate the production of specific progenitor lineages and overall body size. Collectively, our findings uncover a robust, redundant regulatory architecture for cell fate control in planarians, characterized by multiple m\u2076A sites per gene and coordinated m\u2076A reader expression.

    "abstract": "Practice-changing clinical trials for novel therapeutic regimens administered in the neoadjuvant setting have been reported for multiple cancer types, bringing this treatment strategy to the forefront for patients with high-risk surgically resectable disease. Previously, tumor-type- or therapy-type-specific scoring systems were used for pathologic response assessment. The goal of this effort is to update, harmonize, and standardize the emerging system(s) for pathologic response assessment and data capture.\nLeaders in pathology, oncology, and surgery, including those from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer's Pan-tumor Harmonization of Pathologic Response Assessment (PATHdata) efforts and the International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium (INMC), convened to develop updated consensus guidelines for pathologic response assessment, including specimen handling and tissue submission, scoring, and reporting. This paper builds upon previous recommendations, which are updated based on histologic features associated with patient outcomes. Specific attention was paid to commonalities across tumor types, as well as tumor-type-specific considerations.\nA revised and standardized approach to tissue submission is recommended, including total submission of tumors \u22643 cm in size for histologic analysis. Additional guidance is provided for larger tumors. Pathologic response is quantified through assessments of percentage of residual viable tumor (%RVT), necrosis, and regression. Descriptions of histologic features to be scored are provided together with a standardized reporting template. Recommendations regarding collecting additional key datapoints are also made, to allow continued, extended validation of this pan-tumor approach.\nAs pathologic response emerges as a surrogate endpoint for long-term clinical outcomes and to help inform adaptive adjuvant therapy decisions in routine clinical care, standardization is critical to facilitate consistent and reliable application. This pan-tumor approach to scoring and reporting supports robust stratification of patient outcomes, facilitates comparisons across clinical trials and tumor types, enhances data collection, and establishes a foundation for identifying additional, clinically meaningful %RVT cut points.",

The increasing usage of lung cancer screening technologies has increased the detection of early-stage cancers, improved survival, and reduced mortality, but it also brings overdiagnosis or overtreatment for indolent lung cancer patients. In this study, we performed high-throughput whole-exome sequencing in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with a tumor doubling time of more than 600 days (the indolent group) and another group with a tumor doubling time of less than 30 days (the aggressive group). We identified a novel germline variation in PDZRN4, rs74955204 (p.G121E, c.362\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A) in the indolent group. The rs74955204 variant resulted in upregulated PDZRN4 expression and was positively correlated with the survival of LUAD patients. We confirmed that overexpression of PDZRN4 inhibits the ubiquitylation of HIF-1A mediated by TRIM28, thus activating HIF-1A-IGFBP3 signaling to promote apoptosis, and inducing NDRG1 to inhibit EGFR-AKT signaling, restricting lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "RNA modification recognition proteins are crucial in cancer development and progression. Among all RNA modification-related proteins (RMRPs), Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), combined with comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, suggests that NAT10-the sole known writer of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C)-is a critical regulatory protein in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. NAT10 facilitates the malignancy phenotypes and DNA damage repair in CRC cells via its ac4C transferase activity and regulation of PPAN. Specifically, NAT10 enhances the translation efficiency of PPAN via acetylation at the C744 and C747 sites. In addition, NAT10 promotes the translation of ac4C-modified MYC mRNA. MYC protein then enhances PPAN transcription through binding to the PPAN promoter. The newly identified ac4C reader protein MYBBP1A mediates NAT10-induced translation of both PPAN and MYC. We further found that VDR binds to the NAT10 promoter to activate its transcription, resulting in the high expression of NAT10 in CRC. Xenograft studies and clinical data confirmed the role of the NAT10-PPAN axis in promoting CRC development and DNA damage repair. Collectively, our study reveals the role and underlying mechanism of mRNA ac4C modification in CRC progression, providing critical potential targets for CRC drug development.",

CTR1 is the sole high-affinity trimeric plasma-membrane copper-importing channel that self-regulates by undergoing endocytosis to limit copper uptake. We observed that preceding copper-induced endocytosis, CTR1 forms clusters on the plasma membrane, a phenomenon that is typically observed in membrane receptors. We deciphered the mechanism of CTR1 clustering and studied its ramifications on the physical properties of plasma membranes harboring these clusters that could favor endocytosis. Membrane tension and fluctuation are fundamental regulators of pre- and post-endocytic events. Using coarse-grain molecular dynamics (MD)-simulations and coupled interference reflection microscopy-total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) we demonstrated that CTR1 clusters induce positive membrane curvature, an increase in local membrane tension, and a decrease in local membrane fluctuation; alterations that favor the formation of endocytic pits. Clustering is facilitated by copper-sequestering methionine-rich extracellular amino-terminus of CTR1. MD-simulations and IRM-TIRF imaging revealed that CTR1 clustering is facilitated by membrane cholesterol, depletion of which delays CTR1 endocytosis. CTR1 clustering promotes clathrin-coated pit formation that engages recruitment of adaptor protein AP-2. To summarize, we report a hitherto unknown \"pre-endocytic\" \"receptor-like\" phenomenon of ligand-induced clustering of a metal channel, which in turn regulates self-endocytosis by modulating membrane properties.",

Although ubiquitylation at these subcellular sites has been associated with regulating NF-\u03baB-related innate immune signaling, the mechanisms of Golgi-localized polyubiquitin chain regulation of immune signaling are not well understood. We report here that the ubiquitin- and LC3B-binding proteins, TNIP1 and autophagy receptors p62, NBR1, NDP52, TAX1BP1, and OPTN, associate with STRING-induced ubiquitin and LC3B-labeled vesicles, and that p62 and NBR1 act redundantly in spatial clustering of the LC3B-labeled vesicles in the perinuclear region. We also find that while TBK1 kinase activity is not required for the recruitment of TNIP1 and the autophagy receptors, it plays a role in the sequestration of the LC3B-labeled vesicles. The ubiquitin binding domains, rather than the LC3-interacting regions, of TNIP1 and OPTN are specifically important for their recruitment to Ub/LC3B-associated perinuclear vesicles, and OPTN is also recruited through a TBK1-dependent mechanism. Functionally, we find that TNIP1 plays a role in STRING-mediated innate immune signaling, acting as a negative regulator of IRF3-mediated gene expression. Together, these results highlight autophagy-independent mechanisms of autophagy receptors and TNIP1 with unanticipated roles in regulating STRING-mediated innate immunity.",

Depletion of ZNF787 leads to de-repression of nearby genes accompanied by increased local H3K27ac levels. Genetic rescue experiments confirm that the C2H2 zinc-finger domain of ZNF787 is essential for this repression. Thus, our research identifies ZNF787 as a repressor that binds MIR elements and interacts with the NuRD complex to mediate repeat-directed transcriptional silencing. This finding expands the functional repertoire of ZNF proteins and illustrates how specific repetitive sequences can encode local epigenetic regulatory information.",

Using purified mitochondria from rat liver, we show that MDVs can be generated in vitro, and proteomic analyses reveal that liver MDVs are enriched in metabolic proteins mirroring the liver's metabolic hub status. Intriguingly, live cell imaging studies in HepG2 cells reveal a new subset of MDVs that are TOMM70+ve but TOMM20-ve.

Therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating endothelial barrier dysfunction primarily focus on enhancing the stability of endothelial cell-cell junctions. However, the precise molecular mechanisms governing junctional stability remain incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio (TrioN) enhances endothelial junctional stability by promoting the formation of tensile F-actin bundles at intercellular junctions, thereby inducing a linear junctional architecture and packaging of junctional proteins. This structural reorganization leads to an increase in endothelial barrier function. The small GTPase Rap1 is responsible for junctional tension, as depletion of Rap1 results in reduced junctional tension, loss of linearity, and increased permeability. In vivo TrioN gain-of-function experiments reveal enhanced local mechanical tension and a concomitant improvement in vascular barrier integrity within atherosclerotic vein grafts in murine models. These findings position TrioN as a promising therapeutic target for the restoration and reinforcement of endothelial barrier function in vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) modulates gene expression by altering 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) length. Although 3'UTR lengthening typically accompanies cell differentiation, we unexpectedly observed preferential APA-mediated 3'UTR shortening events during muscle stem cell (satellite cell, SC) differentiation, coinciding with increased muscle-specific miRNAs (myomiRs) targeting at alternative 3'UTRs. Mechanistically, this shortening primarily results from reduced cleavage factor I (CFI) expression and allows transcripts to escape repression by differentiation-induced myomiRs. Interestingly, perturbation of mRNA 3'UTR shortening of multiple genes impairs myogenic differentiation. Focusing on Matr3-a gene linked to muscle disorders-we demonstrate that its APA-miRNA regulatory balance is critical for efficient SC differentiation in vitro. Genetically mutating Matr3 proximal polyadenylation site (pA site) impaired mouse muscle regeneration in vivo. Together, our findings reveal that APA-mediated 3'UTR shortening counteracts miRNA repression to orchestrate the gene expression program essential for robust muscle regeneration.",

    "abstract": "O-(2-[\nGLIAA was a multicentre, open-label, parallel randomised study done in 15 radiation oncology centres in Germany. Patients aged 18 years or older with a Karnofsky performance score greater than 60% and a macroscopic WHO grade IV recurrent glioblastoma (1-6 cm) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either FET-PET-based or CE-T1MRI-based target volume delineation followed by re-irradiation with 39 Gy in 13 fractions. Randomisation was performed centrally, using a minimisation technique with a random element and a computer-assisted randomisation tool, stratified by time since first radiotherapy, previous chemotherapy, tumour diameter, MGMT status, and planned chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from randomisation, assessed in the per-protocol population (patients who initiated treatment per their assigned group). Adverse events were systematically assessed in all patients who commenced therapy. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01252459), German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00000634), and European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT 2012-001121-27), and is completed.\nBetween Nov 22, 2013, and Aug 18, 2021, 271 patients were recruited and screened for eligibility, 200 of whom were randomly assigned to re-irradiation based on FET-PET (n=100) or CE-T1MRI (n=100). 85 (43%) participants were female and 115 (58%) were male. 98 patients in the FET-PET group and 97 in the CE-T1MRI group were treated per protocol. Median follow-up for censored patients was 12\u00b72 months (IQR 6\u00b76-20\u00b77). Median progression-free survival was 4\u00b70 months (95% CI 3\u00b77-5\u00b72) in the FET-PET group and 4\u00b79 months (3\u00b77-6\u00b70) in the CE-T1MRI group (one-sided stratified log-rank p=0\u00b798; adjusted hazard ratio 1\u00b714 [95% CI 0\u00b785-1\u00b752]; p=0\u00b739; median follow-up for six censored patients 4\u00b71 months [IQR 2\u00b73-6\u00b76]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was radionecrosis (eight [8%] of 99 in the FET-PET group vs seven [7%] of 99 in the CE-T1MRI group). Acute and subacute serious adverse events occurred in 15 (15%) of 99 patients in each group; possibly re-irradiation-related late serious adverse events occurred in ten (10%) of 97 patients in the FET-PET group and 18 (19%) of 96 in the CE-T1MRI group. There were no treatment-related deaths.\nFET-PET-based target volume delineation for re-irradiation did not lead to a significant clinical benefit compared with CE-T1MRI-based treatment in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Thus, CE-T1MRI remains the preferred delineation method in this setting.\nDeutsche Krebshilfe.",

    "abstract": "Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a major determinant of poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with patients remaining at high risk of postoperative recurrence in the absence of reliable predictors or effective interventions. To address this unmet clinical need, we perform proteomic and bioinformatic analyses and identify lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) as a critical driver of LNM in ESCC. LAMP1 is markedly overexpressed in primary tumors that with LNM and correlates with worse survival outcomes across independent cohorts. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that LAMP1 promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LAMP1 interacts with DNA-PKcs, mediates AKT activation, leading to VEGFC upregulation and secretion, thereby driving lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Importantly, treatment with the LAMP1 inhibitor Parishin C significantly suppresses LNM in preclinical ESCC models. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized LAMP1/DNA-PKcs/AKT/VEGFC signaling axis that promotes ESCC progression and highlight LAMP1 as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for preventing LNM and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is generally an incurable neoplasm. A small cohort of patients with HER2-positive MBC, however, achieve such prolonged remission without relapse following anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy, that it is speculated they might be cured. The genomes of these patients might provide insights into the underlying mechanisms for their successful treatment. Here, a total of 243 HER2-positive patients diagnosed with MBC between 2000 and 2015 were studied. Of these, 29 patients were identified as exceptional responders (ExR) with an overall survival (OS)\u2009>\u200960 months and no evidence of relapse, 54 patients with an OS\u2009>\u200960 months but who relapsed or developed progressive disease were defined as exceptional survivors (ExS), and 160 patients with an OS\u2009<\u200960 months were identified as short-term responders (STR). Whole-Genome Sequencing and centromere copy number (CCN) analysis was performed on 27 patients (12 ExR; 4 ExS; 11 STR). A significant amplification was observed in the centromeric regions of ExR, exhibiting higher CCN compared to the ExS and STR. Digital PCR validation of chromosome 4 centromere region D4Z1 copy number was not associated with ExR OS. Our results suggest that the amplification of centromere regions are associated with very prolonged remission and survival in patients with HER2-positive MBC.",

We calculated cumulative incidences for first and second primary neoplasms for the study population born 1971-2020 and for adult-onset cancers in the study population born 1951-2020. We used multistate models to estimate the probabilities of being neoplasm-free, having one neoplasm, having \u2265two neoplasms or being dead at a certain age.\nThe 50-year cumulative incidence of any first neoplasm was 27.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 23.1-31.4%) for NF1 individuals and 5.0% (4.0-6.0%) for comparisons. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of second primary neoplasm was 21.1% (14.4-27.8%) for NF1 individuals and 6.4% (0.0-15.0%) for comparisons 20 years after the first neoplasm. A person born with NF1 had a 69.8% (65.6-74.2%) probability of being alive and without neoplasm history at age 50 compared to 93.5% (92.4-94.6%) for a person without NF1.\nThe highly increased risks for primary and secondary neoplasms and mortality warrant close clinical surveillance of individuals with NF1.",

We aimed to determine the prognostic value of LVI and develop a modified post-neoadjuvant pathologic staging (ypStage) system integrating LVI and ypTNM stage to improve risk stratification.\nThis multi-institutional study included patients with ESCC receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and R0 resection. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to derive prognostic groupings. A modified ypStage system was developed, validated, and compared with ypTNM stage.\nA total of 931 patients were divided into training (n\u2009=\u2009565) and external validation (n\u2009=\u2009366) cohorts. LVI was present in 115 patients (12.4%). LVI was an independent predictor of survival and disease recurrence, with hazard ratios of 1.70 for overall survival and 1.74 for recurrence-free survival. By integrating LVI status and ypTNM stage, nonmetastatic ESCC were classified into three stages with distinct prognoses. The proposed RPA stage provided superior hazard consistency, hazard discrimination, sample size balance, and outcome prediction over ypTNM stage.\nLVI was a strong prognostic factor, independent of the current ypTNM stage in ESCC. We developed an RPA-based ypStage system integrating LVI status and ypTNM stage that exhibited good prognostic performance.",

Specifically, we found that IRF2BPL is highly expressed in ESCC cells and promotes IGFBP2 transcription, thereby facilitating ESCC development both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the chemical drug ONC201 was shown to effectively impede ESCC progression induced by the hyperactive IRF2BPL-IGFBP2 axis in tumor cells. Collectively, our findings verified that the IRF2BPL-IGFBP2 axis plays a critical role in enhancing ESCC progression by increasing the malignancy of ESCC cells and fostering an immune-deficient tumor microenvironment. Targeting the IRF2BPL-IGFBP2 axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ESCC.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the sequential accumulation of genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). The FLT3-ITD mutation, occurring in 20-30 % of AML cases, typically emerges as a late event. Despite its established association with adverse prognosis, significant outcome heterogeneity persists in FLT3-ITD AML. The clonal origin of FLT3-ITD may serve as a critical determinant of phenotypic and prognostic variability, though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study enrolled 149 FLT3-ITD AML patients. Genomic and transcriptomic profiling defined four prognostic origin subtypes (DNMT3A/NPM1-mutation, IDH/NPM1-mutation, transcription factor [TF]-related lesion and other genetic lesion origin). Within the high risk DNMT3A/NPM1-origin subgroup, stratification by differentiation state showed hematopoietic stem cell arrest conferred an inferior event-free survival compared with arrest at the monocyte stage. Analysis of refractory/relapsed (R/R) cases revealed the prevalence of baseline 13q uniparental dismoy (UPD) in DNMT3A/NPM1-origin subgroup. All DNMT3A/NPM1-origin patients acquired 13q UPD at the R/R stage, arising from either expansion of pre-existing UPD subclones or de novo UPD acquisition under therapeutic pressure. Single-cell analysis further revealed aberrant activation of the DNA homologous recombination repair in DNMT3A/NPM1-origin patient blasts and triple-mutant mouse HSPCs. In conclusion, FLT3-ITD clonal origin demonstrated significant impact on the outcome of AML. Acquired 13q UPD drives clonal evolution and disease progression in the DNMT3A/NPM1-origin subgroup, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Fat mass loss is a severe complication in cancer-associated cachexia, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study identifies the tumor-secreted chaperone clusterin (CLU) as a driver of white adipose tissue (WAT) depletion in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). CLU secretion is increased in the serum of cachectic TNBC patients. Mechanistically, extracellular clusterin scavenges 14-3-3 in WAT, inhibiting nucleocytoplasmic translocation of the molecular clock activator BMAL1, and perturbing the transcriptional repression of circadian rhythm genes, including PER3. In tumors, desmosomal protein plakophilin 3 (PKP3) controls CLU stability by competitively binding to its lysosomal receptor LRP2, increasing CLU distribution in plaques and inhibiting its lysosomal degradation. In advanced TNBC patients, increased amounts of secreted CLU, PKP3 and PER3 are associated with cachectic fat loss. Finally, a targeted reduction of PKP3 or CLU in the serum restores PER3 expression rhythmicity and inhibits cachectic adipose wasting in a TNBC mouse model. Taken together, our results identify a targetable a clinically accessible PKP3-clusterin axis that disrupts circadian gene expression in fat tissue in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "The USP37 gene encodes a deubiquitylase (DUB), which catalyzes the proteolytic removal of ubiquitin moieties from proteins to modulate their stability, cellular localization or activity. Its expression is downregulated in a subgroup of medulloblastomas driven by constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling. Patients with SHH-driven medulloblastomas with elevated expression of the RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) and reduced expression of USP37 have poor outcomes. In previous studies, we showed sustained proliferation of SHH-medulloblastoma cells due to blockade of terminal cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation stemming from a failure in USP37-dependent stabilization of its target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI)-p27. This finding suggested a tumor suppressive function for USP37. Interestingly, the current study also uncovered Raptor, a component of the mTORC1 complex, as a novel target of USP37. Under conditions of low-USP37 expression, reduced Raptor stability and mTORC1 activity caused a decline in phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and increased its interaction with eukaryotic elongation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is known to inhibit CAP-dependent translation initiation. Surprisingly, a subset of patients with SHH-driven medulloblastomas with elevated expression of USP37 and the Glioma-associated Oncogene 1 (GLI1), also exhibited poor outcomes. Using genetic and biochemical analyses, we showed that USP37-mediated stabilization of GLI1, a terminal effector of SHH signaling, increases pathway activity and upregulates expression of its target oncogene product, CCND1, to drive cell proliferation. These data indicate that USP37 elevation in SHH-driven medulloblastomas has the potential to promote non-canonical activation of SHH signaling. Overall, our findings suggest that USP37 may have context-specific oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles in medulloblastoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis to distant organs represents the most fatal prognostic factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). The distant metastasis of tumor cells results from the collaborative effort of multiple subcellular structures, with dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling underlying this entire process. Here, we found that knockdown of KRT81 expression (shKRT81) inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration, while ectopic overexpression of KRT81 enhanced the CRC cells migration. Furthermore, we identified a potential downstream effector of KRT81, ezrin, a member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) protein family that regulates cell morphology and motility. Phenotypically, the shKRT81 attenuated ezrin protein expression and reduced the number and length of filopodia in CRC cells, which were restored when KRT81 was re-overexpressed. Mechanistically, KRT81 formed a complex with ezrin, and recruitment of ezrin to the membrane and phosphorylation at the Thr567 residue were significantly abolished in shKRT81 cells. Interestingly, we found that Myosin 1B (MYO1B) might provide the driving force for the recruitment of ezrin. Notably, combinatorial inhibition (shKRT81 + ezrin-specific inhibitor) exerted significantly greater suppression of CRC cell migration and invasion than either intervention alone. Consistently, KRT81 expression was increased in CRC, and relatively high expression of KRT81 was associated with a poor prognosis. In summary, we identified a novel regulatory axis that involves KRT81, MYO1B, and ezrin, which regulates filopodia formation and migration behavior in CRC. Therefore, KRT81 may serve as a therapeutic target for CRC.",

    "abstract": "MDC1 is a key protein in DNA damage signaling. When DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, MDC1 localizes to the sites of DNA damage to promote the recruitment of other factors, including the 53BP1-mediated DSB repair pathway. By studying mechanisms of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in BRCA2; p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors, we identified a thus far unknown role of MDC1 in replication fork biology. Our results show that MDC1 localizes at active replication forks during normal DNA replication and regulates replication fork progression. It suppresses spontaneous fork reversal and regulates fork nucleolytic processing thereby promoting sensitivity to PARPi and cisplatin. In this way, MDC1 loss improves DNA damage tolerance and causes chemoresistance in BRCA1/2-deficient cells. We demonstrate that limiting MRE11 activity abolishes the reduced fork speed while MRE11 inhibition/depletion overcomes PARPi resistance in these cells. Overall, our data provides new insights into the role of MDC1 in replication fork progression that mediates PARPi- and cisplatin-induced DNA damage, in addition to its role in DSB repair.",

    "abstract": "The renin-angiotensin system is a key regulator of blood pressure homeostasis, with its primary effector, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), mediating vasoconstriction and processes fundamental to cancer progression, including proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Elevated AT1R expression is consistently linked to poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance across various malignancies. Preclinical studies provide compelling evidence that AT1R activation drives key cancer related processes, while its inhibition by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) suppresses tumour growth, induces apoptosis, reduces angiogenesis, and inhibits metastasis across a wide range of cancer models. Critically, ARBs effectively modulate the tumour microenvironment (TME), alleviating fibrosis, promoting anti-tumour immune cell phenotypes, and enhancing the efficacy of targeted therapies, chemotherapies, and immunotherapies. Despite this strong preclinical evidence and supporting retrospective population studies, clinical translation of ARBs in oncology remains inconsistent, with trials often limited by design, patient heterogeneity, and supra-therapeutic ARB dosages required for acute anti-cancer effects. This review seeks to summarise the current understanding of AT1R's role in cancer, highlight preclinical and clinical investigations of targeting RAS, and suggest further strategies to unlock its therapeutic potential. Realising the full therapeutic promise of AT1R targeting in oncology requires a multifaceted approach, including the development of innovative delivery systems, such as TME-activated ARBs, and the exploration of advanced therapeutic modalities, such as antibody based AT1R inhibitors. Rigorously designed clinical trials that include biomarker-driven patient stratification to identify responsive cohorts are crucial to define the context-dependent role of AT1R and conclusively establish its clinical utility as a combinatorial strategy to enhance patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) remains a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options owing to antigen heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we designed a unique chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell (CAR-T) construct (B4M3) that integrates an anti-MSLN scFv linked to the CD3\u03b6 activation domain and an anti-B7H3 scFv linked to the 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain. In vitro, B4M3 CAR-T cells exhibited robust cytotoxicity against OC cell lines with enhanced degranulation (CD107a) and efficient tumor cell killing, even at low effector-to-target ratios. In vivo, B4M3 CAR-T cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival and demonstrated superior tumor infiltration and persistence in OC xenograft models. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) revealed that B4M3 treatment reshaped the TME, increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration, and reduced regulatory T cells (Tregs). Mechanistically, B4M3 therapy upregulated TGF-\u03b2, promoting Th17 differentiation and CTL recruitment, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Our findings demonstrate that B4M3 CAR-T cells effectively address antigen heterogeneity and enhance therapeutic efficacy in OC, thereby offering a promising strategy for solid tumor immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Senescence plays a critical role in prostate cancer, influencing disease onset and progression. However, the alterations of senescence-associated genes during prostate cancer progression and their potential value in predicting disease advancement remain to be further elucidated.\n117 machine learning methods were applied to construct the senescence-related gene signature (SRGS). Temporal trajectory analysis based on bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets was performed to link SRGS with prostate cancer progression. Functional validations of PCNA were conducted both in vitro and in vivo to support our analytical findings.\nUsing 117 machine learning methods, we developed the SRGS, which demonstrated robust predictive capability across multiple cohorts, including our own cohort of 90 patients. The SRGS also showed strong potential in predicting overall survival in patients treated with second-generation AR inhibitors. Temporal trajectory analysis of bulk RNA-seq and single-cell data revealed the biological significance of SRGS and identified Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) as a potential driver of PCa progression. Pharmacological inhibition of PCNA with AOH1996 significantly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy.\nWe developed the SRGS that effectively predicts prostate cancer prognosis and progression. Moreover, our findings highlight PCNA as a promising therapeutic target in PCa. Integrated analysis of multi-cohort transcriptomic data developed an SRGS enabling accurate prognostication and identification of high-risk patients. Results highlight SRGS's clinical utility and nominate PCNA as a promising therapeutic target in high-risk and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) or induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia (AL) generally receive a low-bacterial neutropenic diet (ND) to minimize infection from ingested microbes. Recent studies suggest that a more liberalized diet (LD) might be safe. However, those studies lacked robust designs to demonstrate noninferiority and did not address whether an LD improves caloric intake or nutritional status. This trial aimed to determine whether the rate of major infections in LD patients was noninferior to that in ND patients and whether an LD improved caloric intake and nutritional status.\nIn this phase III noninferiority trial, patients were randomly assigned to either an ND or LD, containing fresh fruits and vegetables. The primary end point was the development of any major infection during neutropenia. The noninferiority margin was set at a difference of \u226410% in the major infection rate.\nThe trial was halted at the second interim analysis after enrolling 214 evaluable patients, because of the LD arm's major infection rate surpassing the predefined stopping boundary. In the LD arm, major infections occurred in 31.4% of patients compared with 20.2% of patients in the ND arm, a difference of 11.2% ([95% CI, -0.4 to 22.9]; \nThese findings suggest that LD is not a safe alternative to ND in HSCT patients and patients with AL because of increased infection risk without nutritional or other benefit. Further dietary strategies are needed to improve nutrition without compromising safety.",

It consists of a degron fused to a target protein, an auxin-related ligand that binds to the degron, and a receptor that recognizes the auxin-bound degron and mediates proteasomal degradation of the target protein. Variants of all system components are available, and we here test three degrons, three auxins and three degron receptors to identify optimal combinations of these variants in budding yeast. We show that the degrons mIAA7 or AID* together with adamantyl-auxin and the degron receptor OsTIR1(F74G) allow particularly rapid and extensive degradation. Basal degradation in the absence of auxin is generally low and can be minimized further by inducible expression of OsTIR1(F74G). Moreover, we demonstrate that the remarkable efficiency of this system makes it competitive with established chemical inhibitors, such as tunicamycin and MG132, and with temperature-sensitive conditional alleles. These findings will aid the effective application of the auxin system.",

Using high-throughput functional assays in cells and high-throughput binding assays in vitro, we subsequently identified specific regions within these mRNAs that mediate their TDP-43-dependent localization and interaction with TDP-43. We found that the same regions also mediated TDP-43-dependent mRNA instability, suggesting a mechanism by which TDP-43 regulates mRNA localization. ALSO-associated mutations in TDP-43 resulted in similar mRNA mislocalization phenotypes as did TDP-43 loss in mouse dorsal root ganglia and human iPS-derived motor neurons.

To define survival mechanisms sustaining dormancy, we examined four breast cancer models: HER2-positive murine MMC and human SK-BR-3, and TNBC murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231. Dormancy was induced with low-dose FAC (5-Fluorouracil, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide). Across all models, dormant cells maintained high Bcl-xL expression. shRNA knockdown of Bcl-xL increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and prevented relapse in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologic inhibition with A-1331852 improved chemotherapy, particularly in TNBC, and transient dosing avoided compensatory Surviving induction. Systemic A-1331852 suppressed relapse but caused off-target toxicity, whereas intratumoral delivery preserved efficacy and safety but failed to eliminate early lung dissemination, as confirmed by ex vivo culture of dormant tumor cells. Notably, disseminated cell frequency inversely correlated with primary tumor size during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, underscoring the need for systemic therapies targeting distant dormant cells. These findings identify Bcl-xL as a central survival factor in chemotherapy-induced dormancy, and suggest that tumor-targeted systemic delivery of A-1331852 may eradicate disseminated dormant cells and prevent metastatic relapse in high-risk TNBC.",

CBX8 plays a key role in cell proliferation, stem cell biology, cell senescence, and cancer development. However, the post-translational modifications of CBX8 remain poorly understood. Here, we report that protein kinase D1 (PKD1) interacts and phosphorylates CBX8 at Thr234 and Ser256 /311 residues. PKD1-mediated CBX8 phosphorylation at Thr234 reduced its expression level by promoting its ubiquitination-mediated degradation, whereas Ser256/311 phosphorylation decreased CBX8 binding to other PRC1 components BMI1 and RING1A. Overall, CBX8 phosphorylation by PKD1 impaired PRC1 complex integrity and activity, mitigated H2AK119ub1 level, caused the upregulation of multiple target genes repressed by CBX8, and decreased CBX8, H2AK119ub1, and H3K27me3 enrichment at INK4A/ARF locus, thereby derepressing p16",

Eligible adults were candidates for both RC or BST, had previous induction Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and received their last treatment within 12 months. The primary outcome was the EORTC-QLQ-C30 physical function scale at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included other EORTC-QLQ-C30 scales, depression, anxiety, bladder cancer-specific quality of life (QOL), financial burden, and cancer-specific outcomes. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) was used to calculate average treatment effect (ATE) estimates between arms. Inverse probability weighted risk ratios (wRR) were calculated using quasi-Poisson regression.\nOf 570 participants (mean age 71.4 years; 21% female), 371 selected BST and 199 selected RC. Physical function was significantly worse in the RC arm at 3 months; by 9 months, there was no difference between arms, and at 12 months, physical function did not differ (ATE, 0.9; 95% CI, -0.6 to 2.4; \nMost patient-prioritized outcomes were similar or better among participants who chose RC compared with BST. These findings support the continued role of RC in managing recurrent high-grade NMIBC.",

    "abstract": "Early metastatic spread represents a challenge in fighting small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic dissemination remain unclear in this devastating disease.\nInvasive traits were investigated in 13 SCLC cell lines using 3D-spheroid formation, sprouting assays, co-cultures and a zebrafish xenograft model. Proteomic analysis was performed to unravel metastatic drivers, which were validated by qPCR, growth factor arrays and specific inhibitors.\nOverall, 8 cell lines formed spheroids, and half of these displayed invasive sprouting in collagen. The 'sprouter' SCLC cells, which all had a YAP1-dominant subtype, showed increased migration in zebrafish larvae and penetrated endothelial cell monolayers to a higher extent, thereby mimicking intra- and extravasation. Proteomics revealed differences in adhesion properties, oncogenic pathways and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. Sprouter cells showed higher expression levels of mesenchymal cell state markers. Stimulation with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) further induced invasive sprouting, while blocking the FGF/R axis resulted in a significant reduction of sprouting in vitro and in vivo.\nThe FGF/R axis is a key driver of SCLC metastatic spread in the YAP1-dominant subtype. These data might facilitate the development of potential future therapies targeting FGF/R signalling to prevent SCLC progression and metastasis.",

Westernization of diet, partly characterized by excess of long-chain fatty acids, contributes to CD, and a metabolic control of intestinal inflammation is emerging. Here, we report an unexpected inflammatory function for ATG16L1-mediated autophagy in Crohn-like metabolic enteritis of mice induced by polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) excess in a western diet. Dietary PUFAs induce ATG16L1-mediated conventional autophagy in IECs, which is required for PUFA-induced chemokine production and metabolic enteritis. By transcriptomic and lipidomic profiling of IECs, we demonstrate that ATG16L1 is required for PUFA-induced inflammatory stress signaling specifically mediated by TLR2 (toll-like receptor 2) and the production of arachidonic acid metabolites. Our study identifies ATG16L1-mediated autophagy in IECs as an inflammatory hub driving metabolic enteritis, which challenges the perception of protective autophagy in the context of diet westernization.",

    "abstract": "Uroplakin-2 (UPK2) is a relatively specific marker for urothelial cancer, often used in the differential diagnosis of tumors of unknown origin. UPK2 expression has been observed in colorectal cancers (CRCs), prompting further investigation.\nUPK2 expression was analyzed in two independent CRC cohorts (N\u2009=\u20091851) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (N\u2009=\u2009467). We investigated the histopathological, immunological, molecular, and clinical characteristics of UPK2-positive CRCs.\nUPK2 was expressed in 12% of CRCs and associated with adverse features including advanced stage, lymphovascular invasion, tumor budding, and micropapillary growth (p\u2009<\u20090.01). UPK2 positivity correlated with higher CRC-specific mortality in both cohorts (Cohort 1: HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.00-3.88; Cohort 2: HR 3.33, 95% CI 2.15-5.16). In the larger cohort, this association remained independent of other prognostic parameters (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.46-3.65). UPK2-positive tumors showed reduced infiltration of CD3\u2009+\u2009T cells, B cells, plasma cells, and M2-like macrophages. Molecularly, these tumors were associated with TP53 mutation, CMS4 subtype, and upregulation of genes linked to keratinization and squamous differentiation, such as KRT17 and DSG3 (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nUPK2 marks a distinct subset of CRCs with poor prognosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, micropapillary growth, and squamous differentiation.

We conducted a phase I study to determine the optimal timing of administration of sorafenib in combination with radioembolisation.\nPatients received radioembolisation plus sorafenib initiated 14, 11, or 3 days after or 7 days before radioembolisation. The primary endpoint was safety. Secondary endpoints included efficacy and evaluation of circulating angiogenic factors. Sorafenib plasma levels were quantified retrospectively.\nTen patients received radioembolisation plus sorafenib. The most common grade 2-4 adverse events included rash, abdominal pain, fatigue and lymphocytopenia. Best response was partial response (30%) and stable disease (70%). Median progression-free and overall survival were 6.2 (4.8-not reached) and 11.7 months (9.4-not reached), respectively. Circulating angiogenic factors showed transient elevation at Day 10 post-SIRT when sorafenib was started 11-14 days after SIRT, but not when sorafenib was started before or just after SIRT. Most steady-state sorafenib plasma concentrations were in the upper percentiles relative to reference curves for single-agent sorafenib.\nSIRT plus sorafenib was feasible, but appeared more toxic than sorafenib alone, presumably due to altered pharmacokinetics. Sorafenib may hinder the angiogenic response when initiated before or shortly after SIRT.\nRegistry: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01893099.",

    "abstract": "Gemcitabine resistance remains a major obstacle in the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we identified USP10 as a positive regulator of tumor growth and gemcitabine resistance. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that USP10 stabilizes IGF2BP3 by removing its K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation. The stabilized IGF2BP3 binds to and enhances the stability of STEAP3 mRNA in an m\u2076A-dependent manner. Upregulation of STEAP3 suppresses ferroptosis by increasing glutathione levels and reducing lipid peroxidation, ultimately promoting tumor proliferation and gemcitabine resistance. Our study identifies the USP10-IGF2BP3-STEAP3 axis as a critical mechanism underlying chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer, suggesting that targeting USP10 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming gemcitabine resistance.",

    "abstract": "Somatic hypermutation (SHM) in variable regions of immunoglobulin genes by activation-induced deaminase (AID) is essential for the maturation of protective antibodies against pathogen and vaccine antigens. AID preferentially mutates cytosines within WRCH motifs (wherein W\u2009=\u2009A/T, R\u2009=\u2009A/G, and H\u2009=\u2009A/C/T) in single-stranded DNA, yet these motifs show large but reproducible variation in mutation frequency, suggesting a crucial role for sequences flanking the WRCH motifs (i.e., a sequence grammar) in determining mutational outcomes. However, the nature of this sequence grammar is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that identical sequence contexts can exert significantly varying effects on the mutagenesis of different WRCH motifs. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that both the sequence context and the specific WRCH motif modulate AID activity by altering the mode and strength of AID's interactions with single-stranded DNA. Repositioning a motif and its context within the variable region significantly alters its mutability. Therefore, the mutability of AID target cytosines is determined by a motif-specific sequence grammar that determines, in part, how activation-induced deaminase binds single-stranded DNA, as well as the motif position.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer, arising in the developing sympathetic nervous system. Differentiation therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) is given to children with neuroblastoma to prevent relapse, however there is little understanding of which patients benefit. ATRX alterations are identified in 10 % of high-risk neuroblastomas and associated with poor outcomes. The commonest type of ATRX alterations in neuroblastoma are in-frame multi-exon deletions, followed by nonsense mutations predicted to result in loss-of-function (ATRX LoF). We treated paired ATRX wild-type and LoF neuroblastoma cell-lines with RA: cells with ATRX LoF fail to upregulate direct RA target genes and show reduced chromatin accessibility differentiation and development related genes following RA treatment. Conversely, neuroblastoma models with in-frame deletions mount an appropriate epigenetic response to RA. Taken together this shows that the mechanism of differentiation in ATRX-altered neuroblastoma depends on the type of ATRX alteration, with implications relating to both oncogenesis and therapeutic response.",

In contrast, molecular dynamics simulations offer crucial, high-resolution insights by uncovering conformational activation mechanisms and by extracting kinetic parameters; however, they face scalability limitations. This review focuses on modeling of the ErbB signaling system, highlighting recent advances at both the cellular and molecular scales.

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) primarily relies on clinical features such as plasma cell involvement, immunoglobulin protein levels, and end-organ damage. However, as early intervention becomes a priority, the role of genomic features in differentiating risk is gaining attention.\nThis study analyzed next-generation sequencing data from 224 precursor condition samples with 51 patients having paired SMM and multiple myeloma (MM) and 1,779 samples from newly diagnosed MM to identify genomic features linked to progression in SMM and those with a low-risk nonprogressor precursor condition.\nOur findings from paired samples revealed no significant differences in somatic alterations and clonal structures between SMM and MM samples from the same patient. This indicates that plasma cells in progressor SMM are genomically pre-equipped with changes that define myeloma. Over 80% of driver mutations were present at both time points, and more than 66% of progressor samples showed only minor clonal changes. We further compared genomic changes between nonprogressor and progressor SMM. Nonprogressor plasma cells showed significantly lower mutational load and the absence of copy number alterations on chromosome 8. They reduced focal genomic loss compared with progressor plasma cells. A scoring system using genomic features predictively identified patients with low-risk SMM unlikely to progress, validated on 101 additional independent samples, and additive clinical value of genomic classification was further shown in combination with 20/2/20.\nIn summary, the genomic distinctions now suggest that a proportion of SMMs with progressor phenotype are akin to MM, whereas nonprogressor SMM has monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance-like characteristics. The results should influence further investigation in larger studies to inform future diagnostic criteria and trial designs.",

We also defined EpiColoStem, a reduction of ColoStem, as a pure epithelial signature with comparable prognosis value as ColoStem. By qPCR analysis of RNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, we demonstrated the actual possibility of using ColoStem and EpiColoStem to refine the prognosis of CRC patients with a simple an affordable method. Initial analysis of plasma samples indicated that both signatures could be adapted for its use in liquid biopsy.\nOur results reveal ColoStem and EpiColoStem tests as valuable tools for refining patient prognosis through the identification of fetal-type CRC tumors.",

The impact of DMPs on gene expression and associated signalling pathways was examined. Functional validation included gene silencing in A549 and H1299 cells, analysis of the affected signalling pathway, and assessment of metastasis using mice injected with genetically edited cells.\nWe identified 22 significant DMPs between PP and PN tissues, with several mapped to the RNLS promoter region, showing progressive hypomethylation from PN, PP, to PT. This hypomethylation was also present in the peripheral blood of patients who later developed metastasis. RNLS methylation was inversely correlated with its expression across multiple tissue types. The DMPs were enriched in Notch signalling. Silencing RNLS inhibited cancer cell proliferation and migration, and downregulated Notch signalling. RNLS deficiency reduced metastatic burden in mice.\nRNLS hypomethylation is an epigenetic alteration associated with lung cancer metastasis, with potential as an early biomarker and as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common pediatric soft tissue cancer, thought to arise from primitive mesenchymal cells that differentiate into skeletal muscle. Previous studies suggest that primary cilia may play a role in the development of rhabdomyosarcoma. Primary cilia are cellular structures that arise from the centrosome and serve important functions in sensory signaling, cell migration, and developmental processes. However, most rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines do not have primary cilia. Because primary cilia are derived from centrosomes, the development of rhabdomyosarcoma may, in fact, be due to the function of centrosome proteins rather than the primary cilia itself. Therefore, this study sought to determine if the centrosomal protein centriolin/Cep110, which is localized to both centrosomes and primary cilia, plays a role in rhabdomyosarcoma biology. The gene editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 was used to disrupt the centriolin/Cep110 gene in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line CCL-136, and the effects on cell viability and cell cycle progression were assayed. Our results show that loss of centriolin/Cep110 leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. These findings suggest that centriolin/Cep110 plays a key role in rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation and viability and that this centrosome protein may represent a potential target for future rhabdomyosarcoma therapies.",

    "abstract": "Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein isoform II is a component of PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs) that also forms patches on nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) and the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Here we tested whether different metabolic treatments that induce membrane curvature elastic stress (CES) in the INM, detected by recruitment of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase \u03b1 (CCT\u03b1) and a nuclear diacylglycerol (DAG) biosensor, are a precondition for PML-II membrane association. We found that treatment of U2OS cells with unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids and DAG acyltransferase inhibitors caused the rapid formation of PML patches on the INM that coincided with DAG enrichment and the recruitment and stabilization of CCT\u03b1, all of which were reversed upon removal of the CES stimulus. PML patches were depleted of canonical PML NB-associated proteins, occurred at sites of lamin depletion, were specific for the PML-II isoform, and occurred in cells regardless of their capacity to assemble nLDs. Induction of INM curvature stress by knockout of the terminal enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway or lipid activators of CCT\u03b1\u00a0also promoted PML patches as well as stabilization of CCT\u03b1 on the INM. We conclude that CES in the INM promotes the reversible assembly of PML-II-dependent membrane-associated patches.",

A more detailed discovery of its peculiarity is needed for optimal application of KN026 treatment.\nWe performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of digital spatial profiling (DSP) on 8 pre/post-treatment tumor samples. Mechanistic explorations were conducted by plasmid transfection, co-culture, CCK8 proliferation assay and flow cytometry.\nCompared to the tumor regions with non-objective response (OR), those with OR had high expression of CALML5, TFAP2B, and ERBB2, and relatively low expression of ESR1 in tumor cells at baseline. The expression of ESR1 had a tentative association with PI3K/AKT and NOTCH signaling pathways which were downstream or interactive pathways of HER2 target and also acted as interactive pathways of ER-mediated signaling. The co-expression of ERBB2 and CDK12 emerged as a distinctive signature of OR. KN026 treatment also reshaped intratumoral activated T- and B-cell subtypes in hot-tumor regions, regardless of myeloid-derived cells.\nBoth HER2 and ESR1 are determinant of KN026 efficacy in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, implying the potential of KN026 combined with endocrine therapy in HER2- and ER-positive breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide molecular profiling has emerged as a promising approach for advancing the clinical management of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), with the potential to improve prognostic accuracy and enable more personalized treatment strategies. In this review, we summarize current evidence from genomic and epigenomic EAC stratification studies, highlighting the proposed molecular subtypes and evaluating their clinical relevance. We discuss how these subclassifications may inform disease outcomes, refine patient selection for specific therapies and uncover new treatment opportunities aligned with tumor molecular profiles. Additionally, we explore molecular subtypes associated with Barrett's esophagus, a precursor lesion of EAC, and consider how these insights can help elucidate the mechanisms underlying EAC development. Such understanding may inform improved strategies for early tumor detection, risk stratification and prevention, ultimately aiming to reduce the burden of EAC. We also address the current challenges limiting the clinical application of these molecular classifiers, including restricted sample availability, insufficient validation and the difficulty of translating genome-wide findings into practical and clinical useful biomarkers. Integrating molecular subtyping into clinical workflows is a key step toward precision medicine in EAC, with the goal of enhancing treatment response rates and patient outcomes. Future advances will require collaborative efforts and robust clinical validation in large prospective studies to ensure that molecular stratification strategies can be effectively translated into improved management of EAC.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor of the head and neck with a high prevalence in Southeast Asia. Although radiotherapy remains the primary treatment modality, resistance to radiation in a subset of patients with advanced-stage disease significantly limits therapeutic outcomes, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified the circular RNA circSETD3 as a critical regulator of radioresistance in NPC. Functional assays in both in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that circSETD3 enhances radioresistance by suppressing autophagy and apoptosis. Mechanistically, circSETD3 binds to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of PDIA6 mRNA, stabilizing the transcript and increasing PDIA6 protein expression and its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Elevated PDIA6 promotes the refolding of radiation-induced misfolded proteins, maintains ER proteostasis, and suppresses the unfolded protein response (UPR). This alleviation of ER stress reduces radiation-induced autophagy and apoptosis, ultimately enhancing NPC cell survival under radiotherapeutic stress. Together, these findings reveal a pivotal role for circSETD3 in promoting NPC radioresistance via PDIA6-mediated modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and they provide a novel mechanistic framework and promising therapeutic target for improving radiotherapy efficacy in NPC.",

Using multi-model approaches, we demonstrate that liver-specific ATG9A overexpression in mice enhanced autophagic flux but impaired autophagosome degradation. ATG9A disrupted hepatic lipid metabolism, reduced lipid droplet accumulation and exacerbated inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, we identified PLA2G6 as an ATG9A binding protein. ATG9A-PLA2G6 interaction accelerated phosphatidylcholine degradation, perturbing fatty acid metabolism and causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Besides, ATG9A promoted tumor growth in vivo, independent of canonical macroautophagy/autophagy.

This processis inhibited by MTOR, but is activated by PNPLA2 via its binding with LC3-II toform LD-containing autophagosomes. However, optimum lipophagic interventions tomanage septic cardiomyopathy have not been developed, thus furtherinvestigation is required to identify novel regulators of lipophagy in theseptic heart. HSPA12A (heat shockprotein 12A) encodes an atypical member of the HSPA/HSP70family. Here, we report that sepsis decreased HSPA12Aexpression in cardiomyocytes, whereas cardiomyocyte-specific HSPA12Aoverexpression aggravated sepsis-induced cardiomyocyte death and cardiacdysfunction in mice. Notably, HSPA12A promoted sepsis-induced LD accumulationin cardiomyocytes. By contrast, HSPA12A inhibited lipophagy in septiccardiomyocytes, as reflected by a decreased level of LD-containing autophagosomes,a reduced content of LC3-II, and an increased level of SQSTM1/p62. In-depthmolecular analysis revealed that HSPA12A increased phosphorylation of MTOR andthus its binding to PNPLA2 on LDs. MTOR thereby competed against LC3-II inbinding with PNPLA2 to suppress LD-containing autophagosome formation subsequentlyimpairing lipophagy and ultimately promoting cardiomyocyte death to exaggerate septiccardiomyopathy. We demonstrated that MTOR competed against LC3-II in bindingwith PNPLA2 to inhibit lipophagy and also identified HSPA12A as a driver ofthis competition with MTOR to impair lipophagy for exaggerating septic cardiomyopathy.

However, the neuronal subtypes where autophagy is required to form new memories remain unknown. Given the well-established role of PVALB (parvalbumin) interneurons in hippocampus-dependent memory formation and consolidation, we examined whether autophagy in these cells is required for such complex behaviors. We show that contrary to other neuronal subtypes, the vast majority of PVALB neurons, with the exception of cerebellar Purkinje cells, survive and are maintained long-term independently of autophagy. However, autophagy controls the homeostasis of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and synaptic proteins within PVALB interneurons, ultimately regulating their synaptic excitation, neuronal excitability and excitation-inhibition balance in the hippocampus. Consequently, mice with conditional impairment of autophagy in PVALB-expressing neurons exhibit impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory. Taken together, these findings identify PVALB interneurons as key cellular substrates of autophagy in the context of learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "The biggest impact on increasing survival for pancreatic cancer has come about by combining surgical resection with systemic chemotherapy. This groundbreaking paradigm has come under increasing scrutiny relating to the choice of adding chemoradiotherapy to chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, neoadjuvant versus adjuvant therapy and the optimal regimens. The paradigm has also been challenged in that a distinction needs to be made between 'resected' with 'resectable' pancreatic cancer, since if only the former is considered, this leads to a biased prognostically favourable patient group being analysed. Moreover, the distinction between resectable, borderline resectable and unresectable cancers is claimed to be so unreliable that this classification should be discouraged in favour of upfront chemotherapy for all patients and not necessarily using either FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-capecitabine. The results of a series of recent trials including the RTOG0848 trial of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without chemoradiation and the NORPACT-1 trial of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX versus upfront surgery for resectable pancreatic cancer have significantly contributed to the clarification of some these questions. The results of long-term follow-up studies of the adjuvant PRODIGE24 trial comparing FOLFIRINOX with gemcitabine and the ESPAC4 trial of gemcitabine-capecitabine versus gemcitabine have also consolidated and expanded the applicability of adjuvant chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Senecavirus A (SVA) belongs to the picornaviruses and has emerged as a promising candidate for oncolytic virotherapy in humans. Understanding the immune suppression mechanisms employed by SVA can help optimize its therapeutic efficacy as an oncolytic virus while simultaneously minimizing its immune suppressive effects on normal tissues. In this study, we identified a novel function of the SVA structural protein VP2 as a key viral immune suppressive factor during SVA infection. VP2 targets and degrades IKBKE/IKK\u03b5, a key component of the innate immune pathway, thereby suppressing host innate immune responses. It preferentially interacts with the selective autophagic receptor CALCOCO2/NDP52 (calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2), which then recognizes the K33-linked ubiquitinated IKBKE and delivers it to phagophores for degradation. The E3 ligase RNF114 is responsible for catalyzing the K33-linked ubiquitination of IKBKE at Lys490, and VP2 significantly promoted this modification, which further accelerated IKBKE degradation. Importantly, we found that picornavirus VP2 proteins share this conserved mechanism in degradation of IKBKE and suppression of host innate immunity. These data elucidate the negative regulatory mechanism involving the VP2-RNF114-IKBKE/IKK\u03b5-CALCOCO2 axis, and reveal an immune evasion strategy employed by picornaviruses. These findings will provide valuable insights for the development of picornaviral vaccines and antiviral/antitumor therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2)-specific CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated promise in advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, the impact of concomitant medications on the efficacy outcomes remains unclear.\nWe retrospectively analyzed advanced GC patients receiving CLDN18.2-specific CAR-T cell therapy from a phase I trial. Concomitant medications were defined as any drugs administered within 30 days before and after CAR-T cell infusion, including corticosteroids, antibiotics, tocilizumab, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), thrombopoietin (TPO), and erythropoietin. Metagenomic sequencing was employed to elucidate the differences in gut microbiome signatures between responders and non-responders.\nOf 72 patients included in the study, 6 (8.3%) received corticosteroids, 49 (68.1%) received tocilizumab, and 22 (30.6%) received antibiotics, 15 (20.8%) received G-CSF, 5 (6.9%) received thrombopoietin, and no patient received erythropoietin. The median progression-free survival (PFS) (2.6 vs. 5.8 months; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and overall survival (OS) (3.9 vs. 9.5 months; P\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly shorter for patients who received antibiotics for infection compared to those who did not. No significant differences were observed in objective response rate (ORR), PFS, and OS between patients who received corticosteroids, tocilizumab, antibiotics for prophylaxis, G-CSF, or TPO and those who did not. A higher abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus mucosae, Prevotella pallens, and Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae in gut microbiome was associated with a superior treatment response.\nThe study indicates that the use of antibiotics for infection reduces the efficacy outcomes of CLDN18.2-specific CAR-T cell therapy for advanced GC, while other concomitant medications do not affect the outcomes. Further research is needed to clarify the optimal administration of these medications and the underlying mechanisms of the gut microbiome in impacting CAR-T treatment response.\nNCT03874897.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant mucin expression is implicated in lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) cancers, yet its clinicopathological relevance remains poorly understood. To identify distinct mucin signatures in association with (pre)tumour subtypes, anatomical location, and clinical outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of MEDLINE articles published between January 2001 and September 2025. Studies were included if they assessed mucin expression in lower GIT (pre)malignant lesions. Fifty-eight studies were eligible. MUC2 and MUC5AC expression was upregulated in serrated polyps and mucinous- and microsatellite instability (MSI)-associated proximal adenocarcinomas, whereas a downregulation of MUC2 was noted in advanced adenomas and non-mucinous distal tumours. Discrepancies in survival in relation to high-level or low-level MUC2 further suggested that this glycoprotein cooperates with other mucins during carcinogenesis. Notably, abundant MUC1 expression was seen in adenomas with high-grade dysplasia and together with high-level MUC13 correlated with (non-)mucinous CRC types and poor prognosis. Similar mucin signatures were also found in small intestinal adenocarcinoma, yet MUC2 was downregulated and increased MUC5AC rather associated with a worse survival, emphasizing the role of tumour location in influencing tumour behaviour. In conclusion, aberrant mucin signatures reflect distinct molecular pathways in (pre)malignant GIT lesions and highlight their potential utility as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Correlation between iENE and pENE in HPV-positive OPSCC is currently unknown yet is vital to determine how iENE should be used to influence treatment decisions.\nPATHOS is a trial of de-intensified adjuvant treatment after transoral surgery for HPV-positive OPSCC. 291 consecutively recruited patients undergoing surgery at three UK centres were included. Pre-operative cross-sectional imaging (CT and/or MRI) was independently scored for iENE by 2 expert radiologists; pENE was scored by 2 expert pathologists.\nInter-rater agreement for iENE was fair in round 1 (Gwet's AC: 0.34 (95%CI:0.26-0.41)) but improved to very good after second review (Gwet's AC: 0.88 (95%CI:0.85-0.93), Agreement: 0.91 (95%CI:0.87-0.94)). Sensitivity of iENE for predicting pENE was relatively low (at best: 56.4% (95%CI:42.3-69.7) and specificity was high (at worst: 70.9% (95%CI:65.0-76.3)). Excluding cases with suboptimal image quality and recent core biopsy produced modest improvements in sensitivity (up to 59.4% (95%CI:40.6-76.3)) and specificity (up to 87.8% (95%CI:80.4-93.2)).\nThe high specificity could help select iENE-negative patients for surgery, but higher sensitivity is required before excluding surgery based solely on iENE positivity.",

Although PNI is increasingly recognised as a process driven by tumour-nerve crosstalk, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the role of sympathetic nerve-derived neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its receptor NPY1R in OSCC PNI.\nNPY/NPY1R expression was assessed in human OSCC tissues by immunostaining, qPCR, and TCGA data analysis. Functional studies using Cal27 and SCC9 cells included migration, invasion, and sphere assays. The causal role of NPY1R was tested by lentiviral knockdown/overexpression, validated in tongue orthotopic xenografts, and further examined by NPY1R pharmacological inhibition in vivo.\nNPY was enriched in the PNI microenvironment, and malignant OSCC expressed high NPY1R, particularly at invasive fronts. Mechanistically, NPY activated ERK and Smad2 via NPY1R, synergising with TGF\u03b2 signalling in tumour cells expressing T\u03b2RI. This crosstalk enhanced proliferation, invasion, and PNI in vivo. Importantly, NPY1R inhibition markedly reduced tumour growth, metastasis, and PNI.\nWe identify NPY-NPY1R-TGF\u03b2 crosstalk as a novel mechanism enabling OSCC to exploit neural signals for PNI, highlighting a promising therapeutic target to block neural invasion and improve patient outcomes.",

However, the mechanism involved has not yet been fully understood.\nIntegrative analysis of HCC patient data with RNA-seq and IHC. Radiosensitivity assessed by colony formation assays using HCC cell lines and xenograft models established in B-NDG mice. USP11 promoter activity measured by dual luciferase reporter. Protein interactions analyzed by Co-IP/GST pulldown; post-translational modifications by ubiquitylation assays. Rac1 activity was quantified by measuring GTP-bound levels. Rac1 structural dynamics simulated through molecular dynamics. Functional validation performed using pharmacological inhibitors, genetic depletion and site-directed mutagenesis.\nElevated activated Rac1(Rac1-GTP) predicted poor radiotherapeutic response. Ionizing radiation (IR) activated Rac1 and induced its nuclear translocation. Rac1-GTP is required for the transcriptional upregulation of USP11. USP11 stabilised Rac1-GTP via deubiquitination at residues K123/K147/K183, forming a self-reinforcing Rac1-USP11 amplification loop driving radioresistance. USP11 knockdown or mutation of Rac1 deubiquitination sites (K123/K147/K183) destabilized Rac1-GTP and reversed radioresistance. Elevated Rac1-GTP and USP11 correlated with adverse clinical outcomes. Critically, combined NSC23766/Mitoxantrone treatment showed enhanced radiosensitization.\nThis study identifies the Rac1-USP11 reciprocal feedback loop as a novel, self-reinforcing mechanism driving radioresistance in HCC. Targeting this loop via combined Rac1-GTP/USP11 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy for radiosensitizing HCC.",

We estimated cure rates and analysed DFS and overall survival (OS) using mixture cure models and Cox proportional hazards models.\nIn 500 patients, perioperative FLOT improved DFS (HR 0.60; p\u2009=\u20090.01) and OS (adjusted HR 0.63; p\u2009=\u20090.015) compared to CROSS-based nCRT.

While platinum-fluoropyrimidine-based nCRT \u00b1 immunotherapy yielded higher R0 and pathological complete response rates, its estimated cure rate was comparable to FLOT, both overall and across all subgroups.\nCure is an informative endpoint in localised oesophageal cancer. In this registry analysis, perioperative FLOT was associated with higher cure rates than CROSS, particularly in high-risk subgroups. Exploratory findings suggest that alternative neoadjuvant strategies, such as those incorporating ICIs or FOLFOX, warrant further investigation.",

We describe the development and application of QA processes to an RCT comparing laparoscopically assisted (LAO) and open oesophagectomy (OO) in patients with localised oesophageal cancer.\nThree QA measures were developed in Phase 1 and tested for feasibility in Phase 2: (i) centre/surgeon entry criteria, (ii) agreement of key components of LAO/OO, and (iii)monitoring adherence to intervention protocols using CRFs and intra-operative photographs.\nAll centres met entry criteria and 30/31 Phase 2 surgeons submitted two videos. Although photos were received for 88.8% of procedures, only 44(14.9%) were complete. Adherence to key intervention components (abdominal/thoracic nodal clearance, hiatal dissection) was consistently reported as better in CRFs than that observed in the intra-operative photographs.\nEmbedding QA measures into pragmatic surgical cancer RCTs is feasible, and provides important data about the quality of interventions.

The effects of IL-33 stimulation on calves were investigated in vitro and in vivo using human and murine iCCA cell lines, as well as fibroblasts extracted from resected specimens.\nIL-33-positive cells and myoCAFs were significant risk factors for intrahepatic recurrence. NGS analysis revealed significant upregulation of various cytokines in cases with high number of IL-33-positive cells. The conditioned medium obtained from fibroblasts stimulated with IL-33 enhanced the proliferation and migration of iCCA cell lines. Among the cytokines that were increased by IL-33 stimulation in vitro, IL-6 was suspected to be the dominant. In a murine syngraft model, hepatectomy led to an increased subcutaneous tumor volume by releasing IL-33, whereas IL-6 blockade suppressed this growth.\nThis study indicated that IL-33 facilitates iCCA growth through fibroblast activation and is associated with intrahepatic recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are essential for lipid metabolism and redox balance, with pexophagy playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. However, the regulatory mechanisms of pexophagy remain unclear. Through functional screening, we identified MARCHF7 as a novel E3 ligase regulating pexophagy. MARCHF7 depletion impaired pexophagic flux under PEX1 knockdown conditions. MARCHF7 binds to PXMP4 and promotes its ubiquitination at lysine 20 in PEX1-deficient cells. Depletion of PXMP4 impairs pexophagy, and reconstitution with the PXMP4 lysine 20 ubiquitination-defective mutant failed to rescue pexophagy. PEX1 depletion also induces TBK1 phosphorylation at serine 172, activating TBK1, which subsequently phosphorylates MARCHF7. This activation is driven by ROS accumulation, which reduces PXMP4 ubiquitination and prevents peroxisome loss. Furthermore, downregulation of MARCHF7 or PXMP4 impairs NBR1 recruitment to peroxisomes, suggesting that ubiquitinated PXMP4 acts as a recognition signal for NBR1. Collectively, our findings establish the TBK1-MARCHF7-PXMP4-NBR1 axis as a key regulatory pathway for pexophagy in response to PEX1 depletion.",

Fourteen tumour DNA methylation-based signatures of aggressiveness and cell division were calculated. The association of epigenetic signatures with clinical variables were assessed using linear regression and risk ratios for PSA recurrence were assessed using modified Poisson regression.\nMost epigenetic signatures were strongly associated with age, Gleason score, and tumour stage but not with serum PSA levels at diagnosis. Associations were also found with risk of PSA recurrence, with increased risks ranging from 1% to 17% per SD for signatures of clinical variables and 17% to 33% for cell division scores, after adjusting for the main clinicopathological variables. The strongest association was observed for the cell division score RepliTali.\nProstate cancer tissue DNA methylation-based signatures of aggressiveness and cell division were associated with elevated risk of PSA recurrence, independently of age and traditional clinicopathological variables.",

However, our recent study establishes their fundamental role as essential signaling molecules that activate a protective adaptive response. We discovered that mtROS serve as the specific trigger to activate the ATM-CHEK2/CHK2 DNA damage response pathway, which in turn coordinates the key steps of PINK1-PRKN/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Upon activation by mtROS, CHEK2 phosphorylates ATAD3A to initiate PINK1 import arrest, OPTN to enhance cargo recognition, and BECN1 (beclin 1) to promote autophagosome formation. This work reveals a novel mtROS-driven signaling cascade, expanding the function of the ATM-CHEK2 pathway beyond the nucleus and positioning it as a central integrator of cellular homeostasis by responding to both genomic and mitochondrial stress.",

Tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) are self-antigens that are abnormally expressed in tumours. Autoantibodies (AAbs) triggered by TAAs have been considered reporters of early carcinogenesis. This study aimed to profile AAbs to overexpressed or driver gene-related proteins (DRPs) in prostate cancer (PCa).\nTwenty-nine targets including 14 overexpressed proteins and 15 DRPs were screened via serological proteome analysis and bioinformatics analysis, respectively. ELISA was then performed to assess their corresponding AAbs in 293 serum samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine the tissue expression of TAAs.\nNineteen AAbs showed significantly higher serum levels in PCa patients than in normal controls. A panel with four AAbs (PIK3CA, SPOP, IF4H, HSP60) was developed, showing an AUC of 0.901. A differential AAb response to these four TAAs was observed in three distinct PCa populations. The panel was evaluated across six other common cancers including 445 serum samples, showing potential for multi-cancer detection. High expression of the four TAAs targeted by AAbs was found in PCa tissues by IHC.\nThese findings suggest that overexpressed proteins or DRPs may have altered immunogenicity, leading to the production of corresponding AAbs.",

Upregulation of IDH1 is associated with poor prognosis; however, the mechanisms that regulate IDH1 expression in glioblastoma pathogenesis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) as a critical regulator of IDH1 in glioblastoma progression. We determined that wild-type IDH1 contained a conserved CMA-targeting motif and directly interacted with the CMA chaperone HSPA8/HSC70 (heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8). Our findings indicated that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CMA resulted in IDH1 accumulation, which in turn increased \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) production.

Through integrative analyses combining RIP-seq, RNA-seq, and CUT&Tag in early embryos, we identified LC3B as a maternal mRNA-binding protein essential for mRNA degradation. LC3B-mediated mRNA decay exhibited faster kinetics than the classical BTG4-CCR4-NOT pathway. Knockdown of LC3B or inhibition of autophagy significantly delayed maternal mRNA clearance, resulting in impaired zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and developmental arrest.

Focusing on adenoviruses, influenza, rhinoviruses, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, we explore a series of molecular case studies that reveal both shared strategies and the diverse molecular innovations these respiratory pathogens use to subvert the nuclear transport machinery. We organize these tactics into six recurring strategies: NPC docking and nuclear entry, inhibition of immune-factor import, hijacking nuclear protein transport and karyopherins, sabotage of host mRNA export, degradation of FG-Nups, and exploitation of mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown. These insights not only illuminate fundamental virus-host conflicts but may also point the way toward new therapeutic vulnerabilities in the viruses' attack strategies.",

In plants, mitochondria are typically discrete rather than networked, but how damaged mitochondrial contents can be efficiently removed remains unclear. In a recent study, we demonstrate that the plant-specific fission regulator ELM1, together with DRP3 and the autophagic adaptor SH3P2, orchestrates mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagosome assembly for piecemeal mitophagy under heat stress condition. Deficiency in mitochondrial fission activity delays mitophagosome formation and leads to an accumulation of megamitochondria that are partially sequestered by phagophore intermediates positive for ATG8 and NBR1. Further 3D electron tomography analysis reveals that phagophore fragments expand toward the constriction sites of the abnormal protrusions from the mitochondrial body. These findings highlight an unappreciated role of plant mitochondrial fission machinery in coupling with autophagy machinery for mitochondrial segregation and mitophagosome assembly, establishing a mechanistic framework for plant mitophagy in stress resilience.",

    "abstract": "The 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) chaperone is essential to maintain cellular protein homeostasis, facilitating the folding, assembly, membrane translocation and quality control of proteins. Hsp70s achieve their functions through 'selective promiscuity', interacting with a wide range of substrate proteins while minimizing undesired interactions. J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) are key to substrate recognition, remodelling and release from chaperone complexes. JDPs either target Hsp70s to specific subcellular sites where substrates reside (recruiters) or bind substrates directly by using highly specific (specialists) or multiple, versatile (generalists) binding sites. Through diverse substrate-binding modes and regulatory mechanisms, the 50 human JDPs confer remarkable client specificity to Hsp70s, a function that is comparable to that achieved by close to 600 E3 ubiquitin ligases in targeting proteins for degradation. Moreover, JDPs, together with NEFs, dictate the fate of Hsp70 clients by directing them to distinct protein quality control pathways, resulting in their folding or degradation. These recent mechanistic insights into Hsp70 regulation not only highlight the versatility and complexity of the Hsp70 network but also offer new avenues for more specific interventions in ageing-related and other protein folding diseases.",

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant standard-of-care for HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer is trastuzumab + pertuzumab with polychemotherapy; however, existing regimens have high toxicity burdens and suboptimal outcomes. DESTINY-Breast11 assessed efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) alone or followed by paclitaxel + trastuzumab + pertuzumab (THP) versus dose-dense doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide (ddAC) followed by THP for high-risk (\u2265cT3cN0 or cT0-4cN1-3) HER2-positive disease.\nThis open-label, phase III trial (147 sites, 18 countries) randomised adults 1 : 1 : 1 to T-DXd (\u00d78 cycles), T-DXd-THP (4 + 4 cycles), or ddAC-THP (4 + 4 cycles). T-DXd-alone arm enrolment closed early following the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommendation. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR; ypT0/is ypN0; intent-to-treat population). Secondary endpoints included event-free survival (EFS; intent-to-treat population) and safety (safety analysis set).\nBetween 25 October 2021 and 12 March 2025, 286 (T-DXd), 321 (T-DXd-THP), and 320 (ddAC-THP) female patients were randomised. pCR rates were 43.0% (T-DXd, n = 123), 67.3% (T-DXd-THP, n = 216), and 56.3% (ddAC-THP, n = 180). T-DXd-THP versus ddAC-THP absolute pCR rate difference was 11.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0% to 18.3%, P = 0.003], with benefit in hormone receptor (HR)-positive [61.4% (n/N = 145/236) versus 52.3% (n/N = 123/235); difference in pCR (\u0394pCR) 9.1% (95% CI 0.2% to 17.9%)] and HR-negative [83.1% (n/N = 69/83) versus 67.1% (n/N = 57/85); \u0394pCR 16.1% (95% CI 3.0% to 28.8%)] subgroups. Median EFS (T-DXd-THP versus ddAC-THP, maturity 4.5%) hazard ratio was 0.56 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.17).

    "abstract": "In SERENA-6, switching from aromatase inhibitor (AI) to camizestrant with continuation of CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) guided by emergence of ESR1 mutations (ESR1-mut) during first-line AI-CDK4/6i in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC) resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival compared with AI-CDK4/6i and reduction in the risk of deterioration in global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) (hazard ratio 0.54). Here we report additional data from patient-reported outcomes (PROs).\nPatients completed PRO questionnaires at pre-specified timepoints, including the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) oncology-specific EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and breast cancer-specific (QLQ-BR23) and Patient Global Impression of Treatment Tolerability (PGI-TT). All PRO endpoints and analyses were pre-defined, including secondary endpoints of time to deterioration (TTD) in pain, physical functioning, breast symptoms and arm symptoms.\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 baseline scores were similar between treatment arms. Switching to camizestrant-CDK4/6i delayed TTD and reduced the risk of deterioration in patient-reported cancer symptoms [pain (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.37-0.86), fatigue (0.75, 0.46-1.24), shortness of breath/dyspnoea (0.52, 0.28-0.93), breast symptoms (0.59, 0.28-1.24) and arm symptoms (0.69, 0.34-1.39)] and functioning [physical (0.74, 0.44-1.24), role (0.73, 0.48-1.10) and emotional (0.51, 0.29-0.87)] compared with AI-CDK4/6i. Most patients reported they were 'not at all' or 'a little bit' bothered by the side effects of cancer therapy across timepoints (e.g. week 2: 86% camizestrant-CDK4/6i versus 82% AI-CDK4/6i).\nTogether with the clinical efficacy and manageable safety profile of camizestrant-CDK4/6i, and reduced risk of GHS/QoL deterioration, the PROs from the SERENA-6 trial support switching to this combination as a potential new treatment strategy to optimise and improve outcomes in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative ABC and ESR1-mut emergence, ahead of disease progression, during first-line AI-CDK4/6i.",

Stratification factors were homologous recombination deficiency (HRD; BRCA mutation and loss of heterozygosity status) classification, residual disease post-chemotherapy, and surgical timing. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (invPFS) in HRD and intent-to-treat (ITT) populations. Overall survival (OS) and safety were secondary endpoints. Second event of progression (PFS2) and time to first subsequent treatment (TFST) were exploratory. Interim OS and final safety analyses data cut-off was 9 March 2023. Updated invPFS, PFS2, and TFST analyses data cut-off was 5 May 2025.\nMedian invPFS follow-up was \u223c59 months for both rucaparib (HRD, n = 185; ITT, n = 427) and placebo (HRD, n = 49; ITT, n = 111). invPFS was significantly longer with rucaparib versus placebo in the HRD [31.4 versus 12.0 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.76] and ITT (20.2 versus 9.2 months; HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42-0.69) populations. Interim OS was immature (OS maturity: ITT 35%) with the median (95% CI) OS not reached with rucaparib and 46.2 (34.6-not reached) months with placebo for the ITT population (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.58-1.17). ITT TFST (median 23.6 versus 12.1 months) and PFS2 (35.1 versus 26.9 months) were longer with rucaparib versus placebo. Overall, 34.6% of patients receiving rucaparib completed the 24-month treatment cap versus 17.3% receiving placebo. As of 5 May 2025, 40.0% of patients on rucaparib were still on study and in long-term follow-up. Safety remained consistent with the primary analysis.\nRucaparib monotherapy provides significant and durable long-term benefit as first-line maintenance for patients with advanced ovarian cancer with and without HRD.",

The phase Ib/II KEYMAKER-U03 substudy 03A (NCT04626479) investigated novel pembrolizumab (pembro)-based regimens in this setting.\nParticipants with advanced ccRCC and no prior systemic therapy were randomized 2 : 1 to quavonlimab (qmab)/pembro plus lenvatinib (lenva), favezelimab (save)/pembro plus lenva, pembro plus lenva plus belzutifan (bel), and vibostolimab (vibo)/pembro plus bel or a concurrent reference treatment (pembro plus lenva). A safety lead-in of \u223c10 participants occurred for all investigative treatments before randomization. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review in all randomized participants (excluding safety lead-in), and safety in all treated participants. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\nAs of 31 March 2025, 393 participants were enrolled. Median follow-up for randomized participants across the five cohorts ranged between 16 and 39 months. The ORR was 80.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 68.6% to 89.6%] with pembro plus lenva, 71.3% (95% CI 60.0% to 80.8%) with qmab/pembro plus lenva, 62.7% (95% CI 48.1% to 75.9%) with save/pembro plus lenva, 77.5% (95% CI 66.8% to 86.1%) with pembro plus lenva plus bel, and 42.5% (95% CI 31.5% to 54.1%) with vibo/pembro plus bel.

    "abstract": "First-line treatments for metastatic clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC) combine programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 ICI or angiogenesis targeted therapies (TT). Upon progression, common options include cabozantinib or lenvatinib + everolimus, although these regimens have never been directly compared. We hypothesized that lenvatinib + everolimus will improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared with cabozantinib after progression on PD-1 ICI.\nThis multicenter, randomized phase II trial enrolled patients with metastatic ccRCC previously treated with one to two lines including PD-1 ICI. Participants received lenvatinib 18 mg/day + everolimus 5 mg/day versus cabozantinib 60 mg/day, stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk group and prior TT. A Bayesian optimal phase II design was used.\nIn total 90 patients were randomized; 86 patients received at least one dose of assigned lenvatinib + everolimus (n = 40) or cabozantinib (n = 46). Median time from randomization to data cut-off date (1 August 2025) was 20 months (interquartile range 14.9-22.5 months). A total of 60 PFS events were observed. Median PFS was 15.7 months with lenvatinib + everolimus and 10.2 months with cabozantinib [hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.89, P = 0.02]. The objective response rate was 52.6% with lenvatinib + everolimus and 38.6% with cabozantinib. Overall survival (OS) data were immature and inconclusive due to a low number of events (n = 24/86; 1-year OS probability 87.0% versus 84.6% [95% CI 0.47% to 2.38%] with lenvatinib + everolimus versus cabozantinib, respectively. Discontinuation rates due to toxicity were 20% with lenvatinib + everolimus and 10.9% with cabozantinib.\nIn this randomized phase II trial in metastatic ccRCC that progressed on prior PD-1 ICIs, lenvatinib + everolimus significantly prolonged PFS over cabozantinib. As the first head-to-head comparison of contemporary second-line or later treatments after ICI, these results are relevant to treatment sequencing and inform oncology practice.",

    "abstract": "In the phase III PALLAS trial, the addition of 2 years of palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) did not improve short-term invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) compared with ET alone in high-risk early-stage hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. In this article, we report 5-year efficacy outcomes, including updated iDFS and overall survival (OS).\nPALLAS is an international, open-label, randomized phase III trial evaluating the addition of 2 years of palbociclib to adjuvant ET in patients with stage II-III HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. The primary endpoint was iDFS.\nThe trial enrolled 5753 patients, with 2883 randomized to receive palbociclib plus ET and 2870 to receive ET alone. With a median follow-up of 59.8 months, the 5-year iDFS was 84.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 82.7% to 85.6%] in the palbociclib plus ET arm and 82.4% (95% CI 80.8% to 83.9%) in the ET-alone arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.01, log-rank P = 0.0614]. No significant iDFS benefit of palbociclib was observed in any subgroup, including analyses by anatomic stage, T-stage, N-stage, tumor grade, prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, age, or clinical risk. The 5-year OS was 92.6% (95% CI 91.5% to 93.6%) in the palbociclib plus ET arm and 93.2% (95% CI 92.1% to 94.1%) in the ET-alone arm (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89-1.33, log-rank P = 0.4051). More patients in the ET-alone arm (65.7%) than in the palbociclib plus ET arm (33.0%) received cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors after recurrence. Conversely, more patients in the palbociclib plus ET arm (52.5%) than in the ET-alone arm (41.0%) received chemotherapy after recurrence.\nIn conclusion, 5-year follow-up from the PALLAS trial confirms initially reported results. These long-term findings will provide investigators with important benchmarks for clinical outcomes in the contemporary management of HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, and may be further used to guide adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk early-stage HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab continues to be used in some circumstances in advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). To investigate whether shorter chemotherapy duration improves quality of life (QoL) without worsening efficacy, this study compared three versus six cycles followed by avelumab.\nThis randomized phase II trial compared three versus six cycles (3C arm versus 6C arm) of chemotherapy followed by avelumab in patients receiving first-line treatment for mUC. This trial had co-primary endpoints of patient-reported outcomes (PROs), defined as change from baseline to cycle 6 on the global health status/QoL score, and superior overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate, and safety. Here, we report the final PRO analysis and interim OS.\nA total of 267 patients were randomized (133 to 3C arm, 134 to 6C arm). Forty-two percent received gemcitabine/cisplatin and 58% gemcitabine/carboplatin. Seventy-eight percent and 40% of patients completed three and six cycles as allocated. Seventy-four percent of patients received avelumab in the 3C arm, versus 56% in the 6C arm. The mean QoL change between baseline and cycle 6 was 0 [95% confidence interval (CI) -5.9 to 5.2] in the 3C arm versus -8.5 (95% CI -14.1 to -2.9) in the 6C arm, with a significant difference favouring 3C (+8.5 points, 95% CI 0.7-16.3, P = 0.016). Improvement in PRO scores was observed in 41% (3C arm) versus 24% (6C arm) of patients. OS was not significant (18.9 months in both arms [hazard ratio (HR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.72-1.86, P = 0.56]. Median PFS was 8.0 months (95% CI 6.7-11.9 months) in the 3C arm versus 9.0 months (95% CI 6.9-12.7 months) in the 6C arm (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.73-1.53). Median grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11.9% (3C arm) versus 15.7% (6C arm).\nThree cycles of chemotherapy followed by maintenance avelumab is associated with better QoL than six cycles. Randomized trials with patient-focused outcomes exploring shorter duration of therapy are feasible (NCT06892860).",

The impact on overall survival (OS) remained unknown.\nIn the phase III monarchE trial (NCT03155997), patients received ET for at least 5 years with or without abemaciclib for 2 years. In this article, we report the primary OS results, a key secondary endpoint, and updated estimates of IDFS and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS).\nOverall, 5637 patients underwent randomization, with 2808 assigned to abemaciclib-ET, and 2829 to ET. In the intent-to-treat population, with a median follow-up of 76.2 months, abemaciclib-ET resulted in a 15.8% lower risk of death than ET [661 deaths; hazard ratio 0.842, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.722-0.981, P = 0.027], meeting the prespecified boundary for significance. The 7-year OS was 86.8% with abemaciclib-ET and 85.0% with ET (absolute difference, 1.8%). OS benefit was consistent across prespecified subgroups. In addition to patients who had already died of metastatic disease, fewer patients in the abemaciclib-ET arm were living with metastatic disease compared with the ET arm (6.4% versus 9.4%). Sustained improvement was demonstrated in IDFS and DRFS (hazard ratio 0.734, 95% CI 0.657-0.820 and hazard ratio 0.746, 95% CI 0.662-0.840, respectively). Seven-year IDFS was 77.4% with abemaciclib-ET and 70.9% with ET (absolute difference, 6.5%) and 7-year DRFS were 80.0% and 74.9% (absolute difference, 5.1%). The long-term safety data compiled did not support any concerns of delayed toxicities.\nAdjuvant abemaciclib-ET resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared with ET in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive, high-risk EBC. At 7 years, abemaciclib-ET continued to demonstrate a sustained IDFS and DRFS benefit.",

The most common cancers were colorectal and lung; oxaliplatin and carboplatin were the most common MECs. Patients randomly assigned to NEPA were significantly more likely to experience a CR compared with SOC (odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.12-2.49, P = 0.012). The NEPA group had a significantly higher probability of CR, no nausea, no emesis, and complete protection (81.0%, 63.7%, 95.4%, and 71.8%, respectively) compared with the SOC arm (71.8%, 54.9%, 86.7%, and 62.4%, respectively) across three cycles of chemotherapy.\nWhen individual risk factors are considered before MEC, a three-drug regimen including NEPA provides superior CINV prevention across multiple cycles compared with the standard two-drug approach. These findings underscore the value of personalised risk-adapted antiemetic strategies and have practice-changing potential for optimising antiemetic control.",

    "abstract": "Hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease with low pathological complete response (pCR) to standard neoadjuvant treatment. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors with endocrine and anti-HER2 therapy have shown a potential for chemotherapy omission in this context.\nTOUCH is an international, open-label, phase II trial for postmenopausal patients with cT >1 cm, cN0 or cN1, HR-positive/HER2-positive BC, randomly assigned to 16 weeks of neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel or palbociclib and letrozole, both with trastuzumab + pertuzumab (HP). The primary objective investigated the interaction between a gene signature of E2F pathway activity (RBsig) and pCR (ypT0N0 or ypTisN0), hypothesizing higher pCR for RBsig-high tumors in the paclitaxel + HP group and for RBsig-low tumors in the palbociclib + letrozole + HP group. RBsig was assessed by RNA-sequencing from pre-treatment biopsies; intrinsic subtypes were estimated by absolute intrinsic molecular subtyping Treatment-by-biomarker interaction was estimated using logistic regression in 115 assessable patients.\nA total of 147 patients were randomly assigned (74 paclitaxel + HP, 73 palbociclib + letrozole + HP) and 145 constituted the treated population, with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range 63-73 years). More patients completed palbociclib versus paclitaxel (94.4% versus 79.5%). The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia and diarrhea (6.9% versus 43.1% and 11% versus 8.3% in the paclitaxel + HP versus the palbociclib + letrozole + HP groups, respectively). The pCR rate was 32.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 22.3% to 44.9%] in the paclitaxel + HP group and 33.3% (95% CI 22.7% to 45.4%) in the palbociclib + letrozole + HP group. No significant treatment-by-RBsig interaction was observed (P = 0.18): pCR in RBsig high versus low was 31.3% (95% CI 16.1% to 50.0%) versus 42.3% (95% CI 23.4% to 63.1%) in the paclitaxel + HP group, and 38.5% (95% CI 20.2% to 59.4%) versus 25.8% (95% CI 11.9% to 44.6%) in the palbociclib group. pCR was higher in non-luminal versus luminal subtypes (45.5% versus 18.4%), with no interaction with treatment.\nAlthough the primary hypothesis was not supported, TOUCH shows that dual anti-HER2 blockade with a chemotherapy-free backbone of palbociclib + letrozole yields pCR rates similar to paclitaxel, representing an attractive alternative treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "Treatment options for patients with recurrent or progressive extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) are limited. This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a B7 homolog 3-directed antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with previously treated ES-SCLC.\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive I-DXd 8 or 12 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks in part 1 (dose optimization) and received I-DXd 12 mg/kg in part 2 (extension). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review per RECIST, version 1.1.\nOverall, 183 patients received I-DXd: 88 in part 1 (8 mg/kg, n = 46; 12 mg/kg, n = 42) and 95 in part 2. The median number of previous lines of treatment was two. In the total 12-mg/kg group from parts 1 and 2 (n = 137), the confirmed ORR was 48.2% (95% CI, 39.6 to 56.9), median duration of response was 5.3 (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.5) months, median time to response was 1.4 (range, 1.0-8.1) months, median progression-free survival was 4.9 (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.5) months, and the 9-month overall survival estimate was 59.1%. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 89.8% of patients (grade \u22653, 36.5%). The most common TRAEs were nausea (43.1%), anemia (34.3%), and neutropenia (34.3%). TRAEs associated with treatment discontinuation and death were reported in 9.5% and 4.4% of patients, respectively. Treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) as determined by the ILD adjudication committee was reported in 12.4% of patients (grade \u22653, 4.4%).\nI-DXd 12 mg/kg once every 3 weeks showed promising efficacy in patients with previously treated ES-SCLC.

    "abstract": "MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3) proteins have long been thought to carry out their cellular and organismal functions, including macroautophagy/autophagy, exclusively in their lipidated form, also referred to as Atg8ylation. They are anchored mainly to the phosphatidylethanolamine present in membranes through the action of two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. Our recent work, however, uncovered a role of non-lipidated LC3s during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We revealed that LC3s, together with the centrosomal scaffold protein PCNT (pericentrin), form a dynein adaptor complex that facilitates IAV uncoating at late endosomes (LEs). We also showed that co-opting the LC3s-PCNT complex is an alternative strategy to aggresome processing machinery (APM) hijacking via HDAC6, allowing IAV to exploit the force generated by dynein-dependent motors for virion uncoating and genome delivery in the host cytoplasm. Notably, the function of LC3s in IAV uncoating does not require their Atg8ylation or the core autophagy machinery, and PCNT's role is independent from its centrosomal localization. These findings redefine LC3s as multifunctional adaptor proteins and reveal how viruses can co-opt centrosome assembly machinery components for host invasion.",

Drugs targeting protein tyrosine kinases have had a major impact on human health; by contrast, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which serve unique functions and together with protein tyrosine kinases coordinate tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent cell signalling, have been underexploited therapeutically. In this Review, we discuss key breakthroughs in our understanding of how PTPs are regulated, highlight their capacity to coordinate signalling and provide examples of their complex roles in physiology and pathophysiology, including diabetes, obesity and cancer. Also, we discuss the development of PTP-targeted therapeutics that are in clinical trials or poised for clinical translation. We argue that the emergence of this class of enzymes from the shadows lays the foundation for a more complete understanding of the regulation of cell signalling and heralds a new era of drug development opportunities to combat important human diseases.",

Here, based on the evidence from both in vivo and in vitro studies, we provide an integrated review of the progress in our understanding of human embryonic and fetal germ cell development, encompassing germ cell specification, epigenetic reprogramming and sex-specific germ cell development.

We discuss the regulation of L-lactylation by writers and erasers, its readers and its cofactor L-lactyl-CoA. We highlight the dynamic regulation of nuclear L-lactyl-CoA and L-lactyl-CoA synthetases, which are crucial determinants of the specificity of histone Lys L-lactylation. We also discuss an emerging L-lactyl-CoA-independent L-lactylation pathway.

    "abstract": "Viral subversion of macroautophagy/autophagy is a well-established immune evasion strategy, with BCL2\u00a0homologs from \u03b3-herpesviruses serving as prototypical inhibitors through BECN1 (beclin 1) sequestration. Yet the full spectrum of their functions remains incompletely understood. In our recent study, we uncovered a non-canonical role for the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded BCL2\u00a0homolog (vBCL2) during late lytic replication. Unexpectedly, vBCL2\u00a0hijacks the host NDP kinase NME2/NM23-H2 to activate the mitochondrial fission GTPase DNM1L/DRP1, promoting mitochondrial fragmentation. This organelle remodeling dismantles MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling and facilitates virion assembly. A vBCL2 mutant unable to bind NME2 fails to induce fission or complete the viral lifecycle. These findings provide a long-sought answer to why vBCL2 is indispensable during lytic infection, and uncover a new immune evasion strategy centered on mitochondrial control. Our work expands the current view of virus-organelle interactions beyond canonical autophagy control and offers new targets for therapeutic intervention.",
