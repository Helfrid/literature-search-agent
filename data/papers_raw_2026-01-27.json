    "abstract": "Therapeutic options after progression on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remain limited for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Izalontamab brengitecan (Iza-bren; BL-B01D1) is a first-in-class bispecific antibody-drug conjugate targeting EGFR and HER3 with preclinical and early clinical activity.\nWe pooled individual patient data from a phase 1a/1b dose-escalation/expansion trial (BL-B01D1-101; (NCT05194982) and a phase 2 multicohort trial (BL-B01D1-203; NCT05880706) in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had disease progression on prior EGFR TKI therapy. Key endpoints were confirmed objective response rate (cORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was 2.5 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks.\n171 patients were included (data cutoff 30 June 2025; median follow-up 20.5 months). In the pooled population, cORR was 47.4% (95% CI, 39.7-55.1) and DCR was 81.3% (95% CI, 74.6-86.8); median DoR was 8.5 months (95% CI, 6.9-11.2), median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.5-9.6), and median OS was 24.8 months (95% CI, 18.5-not reached). Efficacy at the RP2D (n = 121) was consistent (cORR, 48.8%; DCR, 81.0%; median PFS, 6.9 months; median OS, 24.8 months). In chemotherapy-na\u00efve, post-TKI patients treated at the RP2D (n = 50), cORR was 56.0%, DCR was 90.0%, median DoR was 13.7 months, median PFS was 12.5 months, and median OS was not reached. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 98.8% (grade \u22653: 70.2%), predominantly hematologic; interstitial lung disease was rare (0.6%, all grade 1). Discontinuation for TRAEs was 1.2%; no treatment-related deaths were reported.\nIn this exploratory post hoc pooled analysis, Iza-bren demonstrated promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in heavily pretreated EGFR-mutated NSCLC. These findings are hypothesis-generating and are being further evaluated in ongoing randomized trials.",

    "title": "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1\u03b1a Regulates Lipid Metabolism to Coordinate Adipocyte Hypertrophy and Hyperplasia in Grass Carp.",
    "abstract": "Obesity significantly burdens global health. Conversely, some animals efficiently store substantial fat during food abundance while maintaining metabolic health, offering unique insights into mechanisms of healthy adipose expansion. Understanding these short-term physiological adaptations is therefore crucial. Here, using the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) as a model, which exhibits remarkable fat storage capacity, we found that adipose tissue responded to energy overload first and expanded through adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Mechanistically, hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1a (HIF1\u03b1a) was activated in mature adipocytes after short-term high-energy intake, thereby bidirectionally regulating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) to drive healthy expansion of adipose tissue in grass carp: (1) HIF1\u03b1a downregulates ATGL protein levels via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, promoting adipocyte hypertrophy; (2) HIF1\u03b1a upregulates ATGL transcription to sustain basal lipolysis, releasing free fatty acids that activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) in preadipocytes to promote adipocyte hyperplasia. Crucially, unlike obese mice requiring 7 weeks, grass carp exhibited rapid adipocyte hyperplasia. This not only increases the energy storage limit but also prevents excessive hypertrophy of adipocytes. Taken together, our study reveals how grass carp utilizes hypoxia signal (a signal often associated with metabolic disorders in mammals) to coordinate the pattern of adipose tissue expansion, achieving rapid and healthy lipid storage. Our findings redefine hypoxia's role as a metabolic orchestrator rather than a stress indicator, providing a theoretical basis for addressing obesity-related diseases in humans caused by excessive energy intake.",

Here, we report clinically relevant in situ correction of the most common ARCI-causing mutation, TGM1 c.877-2A>G, a splice-site aberration, in human disease models. Targeted skin barrier modulation followed by topical application of the cytosine base editor eTd packaged into lipid nanoparticles yielded functional restoration of \u223c30% of wild-type transglutaminase 1 activity in skin tissue. Toxicity studies and comprehensive off-target analysis demonstrated an excellent safety profile even after repeated application, without systemic distribution of the lipid nanoparticles or the genetic cargo as determined via highly sensitive methods, including desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) metabolic imaging. This study presents comprehensive preclinical data on the feasibility of in situ gene correction of genodermatoses-causing mutations, showcasing its therapeutic potential and paving the way for curative next-generation treatments for severe genetic skin diseases.",

    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m\u2076A) is the most abundant internal modification of mRNA and is most strongly linked to promoting mRNA decay. Why transcripts are born with a death-promoting mark has remained unclear. A previously proposed \"fast-track\" model posited regulated, gene-specific modulation of m\u2076A to coordinate translation and turnover. However, emerging evidence reveals that m\u2076A is broadly and mostly constitutively installed at all DRACH motifs except in the vicinity of splice sites, all of which challenge a fast-track model. We propose an \"m\u2076A surveillance model\": properly spliced transcripts mostly evade methylation, while unspliced, transposon-derived, viral, or aberrant RNAs are hypermethylated and selectively degraded. This model reframes m\u2076A as a default quality-control mark that flags undesirable unspliced RNAs for removal. We discuss literature supporting and challenging this model as well as experimental priorities that could allow for a more thorough investigation of this model.",

    "title": "Ribosome-NAC collaboration: A regulatory platform for cotranslational chaperones, enzymes, and targeting factors.",
    "abstract": "Protein biogenesis requires the ribosome to collaborate with a diverse set of cotranslational factors that shape the fate of nascent chains. These interactions must be precisely choreographed: while cytonuclear proteins require immediate N-terminal maturation and folding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial proteins must be maintained in an unfolded state for targeting to their organelles. Reconciling these opposing demands requires a highly selective sorting mechanism operating at the ribosomal exit tunnel. Recent studies identify the conserved nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) as a central coordinator of this process. By sensing nascent signals and dynamically modulating factor access to the ribosome, NAC directs substrates toward the appropriate maturation or targeting pathway. This emerging framework positions NAC as a molecular hub that organizes cotranslational interactions into efficient and orderly protein-biogenesis pathways. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic principles underlying NAC function and consider broader implications for how ribosome-associated networks enforce fidelity in protein biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Social isolation is a major environmental driver of anxiety disorders, yet its neurobiological underpinnings remain elusive. We report here that social isolation triggers \"ferroplasticity\"-a novel form of experience-dependent synaptic remodeling-in ventral hippocampus (vHip) pyramidal neurons via a glucocorticoid-initiated iron-\u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) axis. Psychosocial stress specifically engages this pathway. Mechanistically, isolation-induced glucocorticoid receptor activation upregulates transferring receptor 1 (TfR1), leading to neuronal iron accumulation, which boosts \u03b1-Syn expression via translational derepression. \u03b1-Syn then enhances glutamate release and spine density, driving vHip hyperexcitability and anxiety. Interventions targeting the TfR1-iron-\u03b1-Syn axis at any node prevent or reverse anxiety-like behaviors, establishing necessity and causality. Translationally, intranasal delivery of an iron chelator or \u03b1-Syn-targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) normalizes vHip neural activity and alleviates anxiety, highlighting a direct and viable path to clinical translation. Our findings define ferroplasticity as a core mechanism in social stress pathology, bridging brain iron metabolism with affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infraction (MI) triggers adverse cardiac events, immune responses, and nervous system activation, but the neural and neuroimmune mechanisms remain understudied. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and tissue clearing, we identified transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1)-expressing vagal sensory neurons (VSNs) that increase ventricular innervation post MI. Ablating these VSNs mitigated MI pathology, reducing infarct size, abnormal electrocardiograms, cardiac dysfunction, sympathetic innervation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). Single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics revealed reduced border zone expansion in MI hearts following VSN ablation. Tracing the effects to the brain, we found that MI activated angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1aR)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), whose inhibition mirrored benefits of TRPV1 VSN ablation. Additionally, the superior cervical ganglia (SCGs) exhibited intensified post-MI sympathetic innervation and IL-1\u03b2 signaling. Blocking IL-1\u03b2 in the SCG significantly reduced complications post MI. This study reveals a triple-node heart-brain loop underlying MI and potential therapeutic targets.",

We address these challenges through in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) along with formation of yeast proteasome storage granules (PSGs). During the transition from proliferation to quiescence, doubly capped 26S proteasomes arrested in an inactive state arrange into \u223c7.5 MDa trimeric units, dispersed in the nucleoplasm and congregated along the nuclear envelope near the nuclear pore. 9-\u00c5-resolution cryo-ET structures reveal that cytoplasmic PSGs formed in various energy-limiting conditions are paracrystalline arrays of bundled fibers, assembled from stacking of proteasome trimers. The paracrystalline arrangement maintains a pool of fully assembled inactive 26S proteasomes that are released in energy-rich conditions. Overall, our data reveal structural steps along the assembly of an intracellular membraneless organelle in situ and quinary structure formation controlling a major eukaryotic regulatory machine.",

This AAVLINK strategy enabled superior gene segmentation flexibility, robust gene reconstitution efficiency, and a marked reduction in truncated protein products. AAVLINK drove expression of intact Shank3 or SCN1A and rescued behavior and seizure phenotypes of mutant mice, respectively. Moreover, we generated AAVLINK2.0 with destabilized Cre to address biosafety concerns. Importantly, we used AAVLINK to build a vector bank for 193 large genetic-disorder-associated genes and 5 CRISPR-based tools with verified gene reconstitution. Altogether, our study establishes a robust method to facilitate delivery of large gene cargoes using AAVs.",

While urine tumor DNA (utDNA) analysis is promising, mutations in tumor-adjacent normal urothelium, namely the field effect, limit specificity. Here, we show that the prevalence of somatic mutations in the urine increases with age. We introduce an improved utDNA minimal residual disease (MRD) approach that increases specificity by removing field-effect mutations. Applying this field-effect-informed MRD approach to 261 samples from NMIBC patients undergoing surgery and adjuvant BCG, we identify three molecular response classes, including surgical responders, BCG responders, and non-responders. Molecular predictors of response to the two treatments differ, with pre-existing immune activation and higher mutation burden enriched in BCG but not surgery responders. These findings highlight the potential of field-effect-informed liquid biopsy methods for guiding personalized therapy and uncovering biomarkers for individual components of multimodal treatments.",

However, conventional devices face remarkable challenges to achieve clinically desirable conformality, spatial controllability, and efficiency, especially to organs with complex anatomies, due to a lack of appropriate mechanical and/or material properties. Here, we report a bioelectronic patch for organ-conformal, kirigami-structured electro-transfection (POCKET) that features high conformality enabled by parametric customization, achieving a theoretically maximum effective coverage area over the target organ. The four-layered POCKET forms a unique nanopore-cell juxtaposition configuration at the tissue-device interface, which induces precise, uniform electro-perforation while expediting intracellular transport of payloads. The high delivery efficiency and precise spatial controllability have been systematically validated with various organs. POCKET-mediated therapeutic delivery achieved organ protection from accumulated DNA damage or ischemia-reperfusion injury, restoring organ functionalities.

    "abstract": "Higher organisms spread external stimuli from the perceptive tissues to the whole body to achieve systemic responses. In plants, guard cells sense pathogens and close stomata to prevent their entry. We observed that pathogen-infected local leaves transmit the danger status to uninfected distal systemic leaves and trigger their stomatal closure as a global defense termed systemic stomatal immunity (SSIM). The underlying mobile signals remain unknown. Here, we report that an upstream open reading frame (uORF)-encoded systemic stomatal immune conductor (USIC) acts as a long-distance mobile peptide inducing SSIM. In local leaves, USIC increases upon pathogen/pattern signals and is secreted into the apoplast for long-distance transport. In systemic leaves, USIC is perceived by the cell surface SUCROSE-INDUCED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (SIRK1)-KINASE 7 (KIN7) receptor complex and induces METACASPASE 4 (MC4)-mediated KIN7 cleavage. KIN7 associates with proton pumps/aquaporins to regulate stomatal closure.

    "abstract": "Understanding the order and duration of events is fundamental to prediction and anticipation. Here, we show that Drosophila estimate, remember, and reproduce intervals in the range of several seconds. This inner sense of time relies on a population clock in the mushroom bodies. Following an olfactory cue, the Kenyon cell (KC) ensemble generates a continuous representation of time from odor onset to odor offset and beyond, with different neurons responding maximally at characteristic, odor-specific delays. The temporally sparse and dispersed KC responses are combined by mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that each connect to hundreds of presynaptic KCs through dopamine-adjustable synapses. Brief dopamine applications reduce the weights of concurrently active KC-to-MBON connections, creating notches of depression in MBON responses driven by KC population activity. Pairing two odors with two reinforcement delays reduces MBON firing and elicits conditioned behavior at the correct, odor-specific latencies. The mushroom bodies thus form a cerebellum-like adaptive filter for predicting temporal relationships between events.",

Contrary to current \"de novo\" models of polarity acquisition, we show that expansion and rearrangement of the preexisting central primary lumen drives early pancreatic ductal network establishment. The resulting ductal plexus creates unique ECM rich niches for endocrinogenesis, which are subsequently remodeled into an arborized system by a new mechanism, which we term \"loop closing.\" We furthermore demonstrate that inner lumenal rearrangements precede outer epithelial branching.

    "title": "Genomic signatures of rapid local selection and introgression drive adaptive phylogeography in the European river skater.",
    "abstract": "Cycle of glacial contraction and postglacial expansion in widespread European organisms, as inferred from neutral genetic markers, has led to classic phylogeographic divergence and a primarily latitudinal gradient in genetic diversity. However, the relative contribution of adaptive loci, compared to neutral loci, in shaping complex phylogeographic patterns remains poorly understood.\nWe generated extensive genomic datasets for the widespread European species Aquarius najas and its relatives (Aquarius cinereus and Aquarius ventralis), sampled across their entire European distribution. Our results revealed that A. najas is divided into northern and southern lineages, driven in part by major biogeographical barriers in Europe through neutral processes. Additionally, we discovered northern populations exhibiting unexpectedly high genetic diversity, consistent with the cryptic extra-Mediterranean refugia hypothesis. These populations showed evidence of strong, rapid local adaptation, as indicated by the identification of 52 temperature-associated genes (e.g., regulating MAPK thermosensitivity). For the Ibero-Maghrebian populations, our analyses uncovered significant mitochondrial and nuclear introgression from A. cinereus into A. najas. Notably, we identified adaptive introgressed genes, including an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter and the zinc finger protein ZFP91, which likely enhance survival and fitness in the Maghreb region.\nOur study presents a comprehensive paradigm for understanding how widespread, limited-dispersal European species adapt to heterogeneous environments through the combined effects of rapid local selection and adaptive introgression, extending beyond the influence of neutral processes alone. Furthermore, we designed and implemented an extended framework for phylogeographic investigation that incorporates both neutral and adaptive dimensions.",

    "title": "Synonymous codon usage defines functional gene families.",
    "abstract": "The degeneracy of the genetic code is increasingly recognized for roles in regulating translation rate, protein folding, and cell response. However, the functional genomics of codon usage patterns remains poorly defined. We previously showed that prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells respond to individual stresses by uniquely reprogramming the tRNA pool and the dozens of tRNA modifications comprising the tRNA epitranscriptome to cause selective translation of mRNAs from codon-biased stress response genes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that functional gene families have distinct values of codon bias in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome by modeling isoacceptor codon distributions using a new approach-analysis of synonymous codon signatures (ASCS).\nApplication of ASCS to the S. cerevisiae genome revealed linear relationships between patterns of codon bias and gene function using canonical correlation analysis. By mapping codon-biased open reading frames (ORFs) onto a functional network of gene ontology (GO) categories, we identified 91 gene families distinguished by unique codon usage signatures. The codon usage patterns were found to strongly predict functional clusters of genes, such as translational machinery, transcription, and metabolic processes.\nThe ASCS-derived model of codon usage patterns in S. cerevisiae reveals functional codon bias signatures and captures more biologically meaningful information when compared to other codon analytical approaches.",

    "abstract": "Disrupted proteostasis causes various degenerative diseases, and organelle homeostasis is therefore maintained by elaborate mechanisms. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced preemptive quality control (ERpQC) counteracts stress by reducing ER load through inhibiting the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the ER for their rapid degradation in the cytoplasm. Here, we show that Sec61\u03b2, a translocon component, prevents the overproduction of ERpQC substrates, allowing for their efficient degradation by the proteasome. Sec61\u03b2 inhibits the binding of translation initiation factor eIF4E to the mRNA 5' cap structure by recruiting E3 ligase ARIH1 and eIF4E-homologous protein 4EHP, resulting in selective translational repression of ERpQC substrates. Sec61\u03b2 deficiency causes overproduction of ERpQC substrates and reduces proteasome activity, leading to cytoplasmic aggresome formation. We also show that Sec61\u03b2 deficiency causes motor dysfunction in zebrafish, which is restored by exogenous ARIH1 expression. Collectively, translational repression of ERpQC substrates by the Sec61\u03b2-ARIH1 complex contributes to maintain ER and cytoplasmic proteostasis.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics provides deep molecular insights from patient samples, but clinical use has been limited by missing values, static biomarker panels, and the need for targeted assay development. We present a framework - Adaptive Diagnostic Architecture for Personalized Testing by Mass Spectrometry (ADAPT-MS) - that enables direct diagnostic and prognostic interpretation of discovery-mode proteomics data at the level of individual samples. ADAPT-MS dynamically retrains simple, robust classifiers based on the proteins quantified in each sample, eliminating the need for imputation or fixed panels. Applied to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid datasets across diseases and clinical centers, it achieves high performance and generalizability using robust, transparent and generalizable statistical models. A single proteomic measurement can support multiple diagnostic questions via retrospective cohort matching, with each classification taking only seconds. As population-scale proteomics datasets grow, this approach lays the foundation for scalable, real-time, and personalized diagnostics directly from proteome-wide data. Such a community effort may help to transform discovery proteomics into a routine clinical tool.",

    "abstract": "Dryland vegetation dynamics play a fundamental role in dust mitigation. While weaker winds have driven recent dust decline in Eastern Asia, the long-term influence of vegetation remains overlooked. Here, using a physically based modeling approach that partitions the drivers of dust emissions across timescales, we reveal that surface wind dominates interannual variability, negatively correlated with the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. On a multidecadal scale, however, vegetation cover emerges as the key driver, reducing dust emissions by 32.5% since the early 2000s-a trend projected to continue through 2100. Without these vegetation gains, dust emissions would increase under various CMIP6 projections. Vegetation contributions are uneven: greening of perennial dryland vegetation in sparsely vegetated regions (<15% cover; responsible for 95% of dust emissions) offers the greatest mitigation by stabilizing the land surface and suppressing long-term emissions. These findings highlight priority areas for ecological restoration to sustain dust reduction and advance regional sustainability goals.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the morphology of Zinc (Zn) deposits is an effective strategy to produce stable Zn-metal batteries. However, the degradation of Zn negative electrodes and changes in their morphology remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the Zn plating process has two distinct stages. The first being the formation of relatively dense, lumpy Zn, while the second involves the formation of porous mossy Zn on its protrusions, which changes into electrochemically inactive dead Zn during stripping. Based on this, we propose a strategy involving a combination of cationic and anionic reagents to revive the dead Zn. The cations create a positively charged inert region on the negative electrode surface for Zn-ion dispersion that inhibits mossy Zn formation, while the anions act as a redox mediator to revive the dead Zn. Consequently, the Zn negative electrode shows a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.7% and stable Zn plating/stripping over 1400\u2009h (10\u2009mA\u2009cm",

Despite exhibiting multiple polarization mechanisms that demonstrate significant potential for electromagnetic functional materials, the practical deployment of ferroelectric polymers has been inhibited by the lack of precise control over polymer chains at the atomic scale and the relatively low stability of the polar phase. Here, a procedure of fortifying the ferroelectric polyvinylidene fluoride phase is proposed by the facet modulation, achieving stable ferroelectric polymer through engineering the interaction between the inorganic rigid crystal facets and organic flexible molecular chains at the atomic scale. The constructed polar ferroelectric polymers composite systems exhibit a broad distribution of relaxation times along with multi-polarization characteristics from megahertz to terahertz frequencies. The composite system mitigates the apparent loss-bandwidth trade-off, thereby achieving broadband polarization properties across multiple frequency bands while maintaining a dissipation efficiency above 99.9%. The demonstrated approach presents a breakthrough in achieving the stable ferroelectric polymers through facet-induced stabilization, providing deep insights for the development of high-performance electromagnetic functional materials.",

In a randomized crossover trial with 39 participants, we found that glymphatic clearance during normal sleep increased morning plasma levels of AD biomarkers compared to sleep deprivation. Participants underwent overnight monitoring using an investigational device that measured dynamic changes in synaptic-metabolic release and glymphatic activity. The observed changes mirrored predictions from a multicompartment model based on published data on A\u03b2 and tau release and clearance. Our findings indicate that sleep-active physiological processes, particularly reduced brain parenchymal resistance, enhance overnight glymphatic clearance of AD biomarkers to plasma. These results support a key role for glymphatic function in AD pathophysiology and suggest its enhancement as a potential therapeutic strategy to slow disease progression.",

Herein, we report a broadly applicable sulfilimine-based approach for selective N-N coupling. By leveraging sulfilimines as nitrene precursors, we achieve controlled release of highly reactive nitrene intermediates, enabling intermolecular N-N coupling with amines.

By developing approaches to implement Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics and engineer temporal boundaries, various temporal scattering processes are implemented in circuit metamaterials. Through measurements of scattering coefficients, we observe diverse topological braiding and linking structures, whose linking numbers are governed by the difference in topological winding numbers before and after the temporal boundary. Furthermore, we reveal that these processes exhibit dynamical critical behavior and host dynamical topological phase transitions, evidenced by quantized jumps at critical time points in the measured dynamical topological invariants. Our study demonstrates fundamental links between temporal scattering and braiding and dynamical topology, opening avenues for exploring the topological aspects of time-varying and nonequilibrium phases of matter.",

We find that TREX1 variants are not associated with increased risk for SLE in UK Biobank, and most reported risk variants are functionally neutral in mutagenesis experiments. Deriving an oligoprotein interferon signature from broad capture proteomics, we find that this signature is associated with elevated SLE risk, but is not elevated in TREX1 variant carriers. Furthermore, TREX1 variants are not associated with other autoimmune diseases with a prominent oligoprotein interferon signature. Finally, meta-analysis of published studies confirms the lack of support for the association between SLE and TREX1 risk variants.

Here, through pH manipulation experiments across diverse ecosystems and with a model ammonia-oxidizing archaea species, Nitrosopumilus maritimus strain SCM1, we discover a unifying adaptive mechanism: acidification triggers a compensatory increase in substrate affinity in ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. This enhancement counteracts the reduction in ammonia availability, with the magnitude of increase being significantly greater in ammonia-oxidizing archaea than in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Consequently, in ammonia-oxidizing archaea-dominated systems, this adaptation can sustain or even stimulate oxidation rates under moderate acidification, while ammonia-oxidizing bacteria-dominated systems experience a decline. By incorporating this affinity response into models, we accurately reconcile prior disparate field observations. We thus establish the regulation of substrate affinity as a key determinant of microbial resilience, providing a framework for predicting nitrogen cycle dynamics under future acidification.",

One of such mechanisms is mediated by cytoskeletal septins that entrap cytosolic bacterial pathogens within cage-like structures. To promote infection, Shigella flexneri delivers effector proteins directly into host cells via a type III secretion system. Here we demonstrate that OspC effectors enable Shigella flexneri to evade septin cage entrapment. Mechanistically, OspC catalyzes ADP-riboxanation of SEPT9 at Arg561, a site essential for stabilizing septin hetero-oligomers. Notably, Arg561 ADP-riboxanation impairs septin polymerization and hence assembly of higher-order structures, including filaments and cage-like structures. Furthermore, we provide evidence that OspC effectors act synergistically with OspG to antagonize septin cage entrapment via two distinct post-translational modifications, thereby facilitating cell-to-cell spread and intracellular replication. Overall, our work reveals the elegant strategies of bacterial pathogens to evade septin-mediated cell-autonomous immunity and offers avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila proventriculus is a bulb-shaped structure at the juncture of the foregut and the midgut, which plays important roles in ingestion, peritrophic membrane synthesis, and the immune response to oral pathogens. A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endocycle throughout the fly's life, increasing their ploidy and size, while at the same time cells in this tissue are lost into the gut lumen as the fly ages. Functionally, these cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when their\u00a0endocycling is experimentally increased or decreased, there is a concomitant change in ploidy, tissue size, and peritrophic membrane synthesis. Further, we show that inhibition of endocycling makes flies more susceptible to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function in the face of cell loss due to aging or tissue damage.",

Remarkably, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate the charge state of the NV centers from NV\u207b to NV\u2070 through STM tip-induced gating. This work represents a significant advance in the atomic-scale imaging, spectroscopic characterization, and charge-state manipulation of NV centers, potentially paving the way for future quantum device development.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and anthropogenic activities threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services. Climate-smart conservation plans address these challenges by ensuring protection of some climate-resilient areas. However, integrating climate change in the design of conservation plans is often deemed too expensive, as it may require larger networks or protecting more costly sites from a conservation perspective. Using mangroves as a case study, we evaluate the efficiency of protecting mangroves in climate-smart versus climate-na\u00efve reserve networks. We find that climate-smart conservation plans could provide sizable benefits (13.3%) for relatively moderate increases in protected area (+7.3%). Moreover, transboundary plans, involving cooperation among countries, require less area and protect more climate-resilient mangroves than nation-by-nation plans. Implementing these strategies would improve the current protected area network for mangroves, which currently has poor climate resilience. Our methodology could potentially be tested on other ecosystems, assuming sufficient information exists regarding their distribution, biodiversity, and resilience to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a ubiquitous post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, that has greatly expanded the transcriptomic and proteomic diversity in vertebrates. While gene regulation of hematopoiesis has been extensively researched in vertebrates, the functions of species- and cell lineage-specific splice variants in vertebrates are largely unknown. Here, we curate transcriptomic data on fetal hematopoietic organ development in six vertebrates and hematopoietic cell differentiation in humans and mice. To identify functional exon-skipping events among thousands of cassette exons in protein-coding genes for a specific differentiation lineage and species, we develop a machine-learning model interrogating 19 features including dynamic expression, protein structure, and evolutionary conservation, and integrate them into a single prediction score, named Functional AS Score (FAScore). Using FAScore, we identify four previously-uncharacterized functional AS events in which deletion of the AS exon leads to defects in erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deletion of exon 15 of TBC1D23 reduces erythropoiesis in mice and zebrafish through elevated binding capacity to RANBP2/RANGAP1 leading to increased SUMOylation level of HDAC1. Collectively, our study presents a valuable tool to identify functional exon skipping (ES) events during hematopoietic lineage commitment, and establishes a research paradigm that can be broadly applied to other biological processes.",

Yet reconciling broad substrate generality with high enantioselectivity remains a core limitation of enantioselective catalysis, motivating the pursuit of privileged chiral catalysts. Here we design a new-to-nature photoenzyme that unlocks enzymatic deracemization of structurally diverse allenes, an entropically disfavored process inaccessible to natural biocatalysts. Structure-guided design created substrate-specific interaction networks, delivering high enantioenrichment for axially chiral allenic carboxylic acids, esters, and amides via triplet energy transfer under aerobic conditions. X-ray crystal structures of enzyme-substrate complexes reveal tailored chiral pockets that accommodate distinct substrates and direct enantiocontrol, rationalizing the breadth and selectivity observed. This work reconciles generality with high selectivity on an enzymatic platform, establishes deracemization as an evolvable route to axially chiral molecules, and broadens activation strategies for stereochemical editing.",

Here we construct both classical and quantum optical skyrmions and transmit them through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded topological resilience of their structure. For nonlocal quantum skyrmions, we show that although photon entanglement rapidly degrades, the topological characteristics of the states remain stable. Similarly, while the vectorial structure of local classical skyrmions is strongly distorted by the medium, their topology is preserved across a wide range of turbulence strengths. Our experimental results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling, validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour is due to the non-separability of the states and the one-sided nature of the channel. This equivalence enables robust information transport in noisy environments, opening pathways for resilient terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication.",

Four risk levels are established and validated using 2019-2022 data through case-crossover and time-series analyses considering sex, age, and geography. At the highest risk level of our model, stroke mortality increases by 13.8% in the general population and 16.4% in older adults, whereas the China Meteorological Administration warning system poorly predicts stroke mortality. Interventions guided by our model achieve nearly a two-fold increase in the proportion of avoidable heat-attributable excess deaths compared to existing approaches.

In contrast, the mechanisms through which the biophysical properties of membrane lipids influence cancer cell survival, dedifferentiation and metastasis have received little scrutiny. Here, we report that cancer cells endowed with high metastatic ability and cancer stem cell-like traits employ ether lipids to maintain low membrane tension and high membrane fluidity. Using genetic approaches and lipid reconstitution assays, we show that these ether lipid-regulated biophysical properties permit non-clathrin-mediated iron endocytosis via CD44, resulting in significant increases in intracellular redox-active iron and enhanced ferroptosis susceptibility. Using a combination of in vitro three-dimensional microvascular network systems and in vivo animal models, we show that loss of ether lipids from plasma membranes also strongly attenuates extravasation, metastatic burden and cancer stemness. These findings illuminate a mechanism whereby ether lipids in carcinoma cells serve as key regulators of malignant progression while conferring a unique vulnerability that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention.",

We develop systematic methods both for classically simulating quantum sets and for showing that no such simulation exists, thereby certifying quantum coherence. In particular, we determine the exact noise rates required to classically simulate the entire state space of quantum theory. We also reveal connections between the operational classicality of sets and the well-known fundamental concepts of joint measurability and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Here, we present an avenue to understand how and to what extent quantum states defy generic models based on classical devices, which also has relevant implications for quantum information applications.",

This approach was validated using well-characterised transducing systems and subsequently applied to faecal viromes from three healthy donors. Our analysis reveals that bacterial DNA encapsidation is widespread in the gut microbiome, with up to 5.4% of capsid-packaged DNA derived from bacterial genomes. Generalised transduction and GTA activity were especially prominent in Oscillospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (e.g. Faecalibacterium spp.), while lateral transduction was observed in Bacteroides. Additionally, we detected induction of prophages in several highly prevalent gut bacterial taxa. These findings reveal the prevalence of bacterial DNA packaging via virus or virus-like capsids in the human gut, shedding light on the diverse mechanisms that drive this process.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, synthetic contact matrices derived from mobility and behavioral data emerged as a scalable alternative to empirical contact surveys, yet their comparative performance remained unclear. Here, we systematically evaluate synthetic and empirical age-stratified contact matrices in France from March 2020 to May 2022, comparing contact patterns and their ability to reproduce observed epidemic dynamics. While both sources captured similar temporal trends in contacts, empirical matrices recorded 3.4 times more contacts for individuals under 19 than synthetic matrices during school-open periods. The model parameterized with synthetic matrices provided the best fit to hospital admissions and best captured hospitalization patterns for adolescents, adults, and seniors, whereas deviations remained for children across both models. Neither matrix allowed models to fully reproduce serological trends in children, highlighting the challenges both approaches face in capturing their disease-relevant contacts. The weekly update of synthetic matrices enabled smoother reconstructions of hospitalization trends during transitional phases, while empirical matrices required strong assumptions between survey waves. These findings support synthetic matrices as a reliable, flexible, cost-effective operational tool for real-time epidemic modeling, and highlight the need for routine collection of age-stratified mobility data to improve pandemic response.",

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the core mammalian ERAD complex, comprising the ER lectin OS9, SEL1L, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1. The structure, validated by mutagenesis and crosslinking assays, reveals a dimeric assembly of the core complex in which SEL1L and OS9 form a claw-like configuration in the ER lumen that mediates substrate engagement, while HRD1 dimerizes within the membrane that may facilitate substrate translocation. Furthermore, pathogenic SEL1L mutations at the SEL1L-OS9 (Gly585Asp) and SEL1L-HRD1 (Ser658Pro) interfaces disrupt complex formation and impair ERAD activity. A newly identified disease-associated HRD1 variant (Ala91Asp), located in transmembrane helix 3, impairs HRD1 dimerization and substrate processing. These findings provide structural and functional insights for mammalian SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD and elucidate how mutations destabilizing this machinery contribute to human disease.",

Multiple aldoses were detected in the Orgueil meteorite, including ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, and the ketopentose ribulose, several of which display near-racemic distributions consistent with an extraterrestrial origin. Recovery experiments demonstrate that sugar abundances are severely underestimated. Despite this limitation, pentose abundances are comparable to those of some C4-C5 amino acid enantiomers, implying higher true concentrations. These results indicate efficient abiotic sugar formation in space and suggest that meteorites may have delivered a broader range of prebiotically relevant sugars to early Earth than previously recognized.",

While organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are used extensively to measure the \u00b5C* product, if there is a kink in the transistor current, then the \u00b5C* product is overestimated.

    "title": "Cryo-EM structures of human ClpXP reveal mechanisms of assembly and proteolytic activation.",
    "abstract": "The human ClpXP complex (hClpXP) orchestrates mitochondrial protein quality control through targeted degradation of misfolded and unnecessary proteins. While bacterial ClpXP systems are well characterized, the assembly and regulation of human ClpXP remain poorly understood. In this study, we elucidate the complete assembly pathway of hClpXP through high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures. Our findings confirm that hClpP exists as a single-ring heptamer in isolation and reveal a previously undocumented initial assembly complex in which hexameric hClpX first engages with heptameric hClpP. We further demonstrate how this interaction drives substantial conformational rearrangements that facilitate the formation of tetradecameric hClpP within the fully assembled complex. Notably, we characterize a unique eukaryotic sequence in hClpX, termed the E-loop, which plays a critical role in stabilizing hexamer assembly and maintaining ATPase activity. Additionally, we show that peptide binding at the hClpP active site triggers further structural changes essential for achieving full proteolytic competence. Together, these structures provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the stepwise assembly and activation of hClpXP, significantly advancing our understanding of this essential mitochondrial protein degradation machinery.",

    "abstract": "Technological innovations in Africa and western Europe in the later part of the Middle Pleistocene signal the behavioural complexity of hominin populations. Yet, at the same time, it has long been believed that hominin technologies in Eastern Asia lack signs of innovation and sophistication. Here, we report on technological innovations occurring at Xigou, in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Region, central China, dating to ~160,000-72,000 years ago. Technological, typological, and functional analyses reveal the presence of advanced technological behaviours spanning over a 90,000-year period. The Xigou hominins used core-on-flake and discoid methods to effectively obtain small dimensional flakes to manufacture a diverse range of tool forms. The identification of the hafted tools provides the earliest evidence for composite tools in Eastern Asia, to our knowledge. Technological innovations revealed at Xigou and other contemporary sites in China correspond with increasing evidence for Late Quaternary hominin morphological variability, including larger brain sizes, such as demonstrated at Lingjing (Xuchang) in central China. The complex technological advancements recorded at Xigou indicate that hominins developed adaptive strategies that enhanced their survivability across fluctuating environments of the late Middle Pleistocene and middle Late Pleistocene in Eastern Asia.",

    "title": "Past, Present, and Future of Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma and AL Amyloidosis.",
    "abstract": "For over half a century, dexamethasone has been a backbone of treatment regimens for plasma cell disorders such as multiple myeloma (MM) and light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. Dexamethasone doses of approximately 40 milligrams (mg) once weekly are often continued for months or years despite accumulating evidence that they can cause dose-dependent toxicities such as cataracts and infections. Acute dexamethasone-related toxicities such as insomnia or pedal edema, even if low-grade by clinical criteria, can significantly interfere with patient quality of life. In the past 5 years, several trials have demonstrated the efficacy and improved tolerability of corticosteroid-sparing regimens in MM. In this review, we discuss these and other studies to comprehensively assess the role of dexamethasone in the modern era. In newly diagnosed MM, robust data support planned dexamethasone discontinuation after one to two cycles in older and frailer patients. In the maintenance setting, the risk-benefit ratio of prolonged dexamethasone is unfavorable. While randomized trials have shown that once-weekly dexamethasone adds value within doublet regimens in relapsed/refractory MM, its contribution to triplet and quadruplet regimens is uncertain. Furthermore, data suggest that indefinite dexamethasone may actually limit the feasibility and efficacy of subsequent postprogression therapies. In AL amyloidosis, dexamethasone 40 mg once weekly for 6 months is excessive and may predispose patients to volume overload. In our review, we also discuss dexamethasone as a premedication for CD38-targeted monoclonal antibodies (where it is no longer required after one to two cycles) and for supportive care (where lower doses of 4-8 mg as needed can often suffice). Despite the historical inertia of corticosteroid-containing regimens in clinical trials and practice guidelines, corticosteroid-sparing regimens warrant prospective investigation across the gamut of plasma cell disorders.",

    "abstract": "Pain associated with oral cancer is debilitating. Opioids are the gold standard for cancer pain management, but tolerance and side effects limit their use. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is commonly amplified in oral tumors. Here, we found that EGFR activation contributed to both oral cancer pain and opioid tolerance by sensitizing trigeminal ganglion (TG) cells, the main sensory neurons innervating the face and mouth. EGFR ligands were secreted by oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and by peripheral glial cells cocultured with OSCC cells. In human OSCC and an orthotopic mouse model, EGFR was abundant in tumor-innervating TG nerves. Oral cancer pain and opioid tolerance in the mice were increased by EGFR ligands and reduced by EGFR inhibitors. In mice, the abundance of glutamate-type NMDA receptors (NMDARs) was also increased in both the TG and the brainstem. Upon activation by ligands or OSCC cell supernatant, EGFR phosphorylated the NMDAR subunit GluN2B, which increased electrical currents and sensitized pre- and postsynaptic NMDARs in the brainstem. This sensitization was also seen in the brainstems of mice receiving chronic morphine treatment and was mitigated by EGFR blockade. These findings suggest that EGFR-targeted cancer therapeutics may be repurposed to manage cancer pain and reduce opioid tolerance in patients with OSCC.",

    "abstract": "Retinal organoids have become important models for studying development and disease, yet stochastic heterogeneity in the formation of cell types, tissues, and phenotypes remains a major challenge. This limits our ability to precisely experimentally address the early developmental trajectories towards these outcomes. Here, we utilize deep learning to predict the differentiation path and resulting tissues in retinal organoids well before they become visually discernible. Our approach effectively bypasses the challenge of organoid-related heterogeneity in tissue formation. For this, we acquired a high-resolution time-lapse imaging dataset comprising about 1,000 organoids and over 100,000 images enabling precise temporal tracking of organoid development. By combining expert annotations with advanced image analysis of organoid morphology, we characterized the heterogeneity of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and lens tissues, as well as global organoid morphologies over time. Using this training set, our deep learning approach accurately predicts the emergence and size of RPE and lens tissue formation as well as similarities in overall organoid morphology on an organoid-by-organoid basis at early developmental stages, refining our understanding of when early lineage decisions are made. This approach advances knowledge of tissue and phenotype decision-making in organoid development and can inform the design of similar predictive platforms for other organoid systems, paving the way for more standardized and reproducible organoid research. Finally, it provides a direct focus on early developmental time points for in-depth molecular analyses, alleviated from confounding effects of heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of cancer immunotherapy resistance, coupled with substantial tumor heterogeneity, underscores the urgent need for innovative therapeutic targets. A deeper understanding of immunoregulatory mechanisms would provide new targets and combination therapeutic strategies for tumor therapy. In this study, we demonstrate that HSD17B12 enhances anti-tumor immunity and represents a promising therapeutic target. Mechanistically, HSD17B12 promotes lysosome-dependent degradation of PD-L1 via the VAC14 and ESCRT complexes across various malignancies, regardless of its 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase activity. HSD17B12-deficient cells displayed PD-L1 accumulation in both tumor cells and exosomes, reducing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Notably, we found a significant negative correlation between HSD17B12 and PD-L1 expression in colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, high HSD17B12 expression in CRC correlated with increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. Based on these findings, we designed a peptide, HSD-CC1-NPGY, which effectively reduces PD-L1 expression in cells and suppresses tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, our results establish HSD17B12 as an important regulator of anti-tumor immunity and a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-Dotatate) is an effective and safe treatment for patients with metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP NET). While 177Lu-Dotatate prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) and preserves quality of life (QoL), objective response rates (ORR) remain limited. Capecitabine, as radiosensitizer, could increase efficacy without increasing 177Lu-Dotatate activity. This phase II randomized controlled trial investigated the additional cytotoxic or radiosensitizing effect of capecitabine in combination with 177Lu-Dotatate.\nPatients with advanced somatostatin receptor positive GEP NET or bronchopulmonary NET were scheduled for four cycles of 7.4 GBq 177Lu-Dotatate and capecitabine or 177Lu-Dotatate alone. Capecitabine (1650 mg/m2/day) was administered for two weeks from the start of each PRRT cycle. Primary endpoints were ORR, PFS and median overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included biochemical response, adverse events and QoL.\n111 of the 200 predefined patients were randomized for 177Lu-Dotatate/capecitabine (n=50) or 177Lu-Dotatate (n=61). According to the intention-to-treat analysis, ORR was 32% for 177Lu-Dotatate/capecitabine group versus 46% for 177Lu-Dotatate group (p=0.348). Treatment with 177Lu-Dotatate/capecitabine did not prolong median PFS (45.7 versus 31.7 months, p=0.629) or median OS (75.8 versus 61.4 months, p=0.530).

FDA-approved ADCs such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), sacituzumab govitecan (SG), and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) have demonstrated clinical benefit; however, drug resistance will almost inevitably emerge in the metastatic setting, and there is no established strategy for selecting subsequent ADCs after disease progression to the first exposure to the ADC. This study aimed to define mechanisms of acquired resistance and evaluate rational sequencing approaches.\nWe generated breast cancer cell lines resistant to T-DXd (TDXd-R) and SG (SG-R). We assessed antigen expression, internalization, and resistance pathways, including efflux transporter activity. To identify therapeutic strategies, we tested the efficacy of ADCs carrying non-Topo1 payloads in vitro and in vivo models.\nResistance in both TDXd-R and SG-R models was primarily mediated by payload-specific factors, notably upregulation of efflux transporters, rather than loss of antigen expression. Switching to ADCs with mechanistically different payloads, including microtubule inhibitors, restored antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.\nCross-resistance to sequential ADCs is primarily driven by shared payload mechanisms rather than loss of the target. Our data also suggest that the clinical benefit of sequential Topo1-based ADCs may be reduced following disease progression on a Topo1-based ADC, likely due to these shared resistance pathways. Importantly, switching to ADCs with non-cross-resistant payload classes may offer a more effective approach to guide ADC sequencing in patients with metastatic breast cancer, supporting payload diversification as a clinically actionable strategy.",

We developed metrics to measure this epigenetic instability, termed the Epigenetic Instability Index (EII), for cancer screening via cfDNA methylation.\nMachine learning classifiers employing the EII of these 269 regions efficiently identified breast and lung cancer from cfDNA, differentiating even stage IA LUAD with ~81% sensitivity and early-stage breast cancer with ~68% sensitivity, both at 95% specificity.\nOur studies demonstrate that quantifying epigenetic instability is a novel, capable approach to distinguishing cancer from normal cases using cfDNA, performing better than standard approaches using absolute methylation changes.

The challenge of adequate patient and therapy selection can be overcome by leveraging the theranostic approach. We previously established a Trop-2.2 antibody for immunoPET imaging allowing us to theoretically select patients with positive Trop-2 lesions.\nIn this work, the antibody, Trop-2.2, was repurposed for Lutetium-177, Actinium-225, and Lead-212 radiotherapies. We explored the benefits of direct, tandem, pretargeted, and fractionated approaches to radiopharmaceutical dosing.\nTherapy with the alpha emitter Actinium-225 regressed tumors, with 8/10 mice alive after 150 days. Alternatively, Lead-212, a shorter-lived in vivo alpha generator therapeutic, was found to be more effective when harnessing the pretargeting strategy compared to a directly labeled approach. Our in-house Lead-212 production allowed us to investigate fractionated dosing on a weekly basis. Fractionation resulted in tumor reductions through 12 weeks of therapy with minimal and reversible blood toxicity for the lowest dose. With repeat administrations, we found pathologically significant renal and ovarian toxicity attributable to Lead-212 administration, but an otherwise effective pretargeting method.\nHere, we provide several direct and pretargeted radiopharmaceutical variants yielding therapeutic benefit for a Trop-2.2 expressing pancreatic cancer model.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC) migration via afferent lymphatics to draining LNs (dLNs) occurs in distinct steps that require the chemokine C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21). In addition to full-length CCL21, which forms an immobilized perilymphatic gradient, a truncated soluble variant with enhanced gradient-forming capacity (CCL21-\u0394C) was recently identified in tissues. We show that in skin, plasmin is continuously activated in a urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-dependent manner on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and cleaves full-length CCL21, generating CCL21-\u0394C. Inflammatory conditions, while promoting overall DC migration, markedly enhance this process, reducing immobilized perilymphatic CCL21 and increasing dermal CCL21-\u0394C levels. Inhibition of uPA-mediated CCL21 cleavage causes full-length CCL21 to accumulate around dermal lymphatics, while CCL21-\u0394C levels decline in the skin and dLN subcapsular sinus. Consequently, DC entry into afferent lymphatics is diminished, whereas DC egress from the subcapsular sinus into the LN parenchyma is enhanced. These findings reveal uPA/plasmin-dependent regulation of lymphatic CCL21 gradients and identify CCL21-\u0394C as critical for DC migration.",

    "abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is the most aggressive type of thyroid cancer with survival time of only 7-10 months. Previous work revealed reduced proportions and cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in ATC tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we investigated the role of super-enhancers (SEs), clusters of adjacent enhancers and drive high expression of genes, in reshaping the TME in ATC. Comprehensive profiling of the SE landscapes in ATC revealed activation of oncogenic SEs as a mechanism underlying the dedifferentiation and anaplastic transformation of thyroid cancer. An SE signature based on recurrent SEs in ATC was associated with significantly shortened overall patient survival. FOSL1 was identified as an SE-driven transcriptional factor that was crucial for epigenetic remodeling of ATC cells. Interestingly, FOSL1 bound to its own SE, promoted chromatin looping and spatial proximity of the distal SE with its promoter, and maintained its high expression, forming a positive feedback self-regulation circuit. During ATC progression, FOSL1 boosted expression of metalloproteinases ADAM9 and MMP14 via binding to their SEs, which promoted MICA shedding from the cell surface and led to subsequent immune escape from NK cell killing. Silencing FOSL1, ADAM9, or MMP9 sensitized ATC cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and suppressed ATC growth in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the role of FOSL1 in chromatin remodeling of ATC and in dampening cytotoxic functions of NK cells, thereby providing insights into the development of potential cancer therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic resistance to DNA damage is a significant challenge in oncology. To gain insight into biological mechanisms that cause DNA damage resistance and to inform strategies for achieving synergy with therapeutic radiation, we performed parallel pooled genetic CRISPR-Cas9 screening for survival in high-risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) subtypes. Surprisingly, in addition to known mediators of radiotherapy response, including ATM, DNAPK, and NF-\u03baB signaling, loss of JAK1 was identified as a driver of tumor cell radioresistance. Knockout of JAK1 in HNSCC increased cell survival by enhancing the DNA damage-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest and delaying progression to radiation-induced mitotic catastrophe. In line with this finding, both JAK1 knockout and kinase inhibition with abrocitinib prevented subsequent formation of radiation-induced micronuclei. Loss of JAK1 function did not affect canonical CDK1 signaling but instead reduced activation of PLK1 and AURKA, two kinases with auxiliary roles in the regulation of G2 and M phase progression. Correspondingly, using both EdU labelling and live cell imaging techniques, JAK1 loss was found to cause prolonged metaphase, mitotic slippage, and progression to tetraploidy. Targeting the mitotic kinesin KIF18A with the small molecule sovilnesib exacerbated mitotic stress and enhanced the efficacy of radiation. These studies establish KIF18A inhibition as a strategy to counteract the protective G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage and to thus enhance tumor cell sensitivity to radiation therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (calves) play a crucial role in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) and driving tumor progression. While single-cell transcriptomics has revealed the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of calves, effective therapeutic strategies targeting calves remain urgently needed. Here, we identified LRRC15+ calves as a tumor-specific CALF subset in lung cancer and proposed LRRC15 as a potential therapeutic target. LRRC15 deficiency suppressed lung cancer progression in mice by modulating macrophage polarization and enhancing CD8+ T cell activation. Mechanistically, LRRC15 deficiency inhibited CD206+ macrophage polarization by reducing extracellular matrix (ECM) production in calves, leading to increased CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. Finally, development of a bispecific antibody targeting LRRC15 and TGF-\u03b2 enabled effective downregulation of LRRC15 expression in calves and limited tumor progression in mice. This study highlights LRRC15 as a promising therapeutic target and provides insights into CALF-directed cancer treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) shaped by intestinal microbiota. In this study, 16S rRNA sequencing of CRC patient tissues identified Prevotella, particularly the dominant species Prevotella copri (P. copri), as a key intratumoral bacterium. The parenchymal invasion of P. copri was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the abundance of P. copri correlated with advanced tumor stages and postoperative serological markers. Notably, the reduced abundance of P. copri in paired normal tissues implied potential bacterial translocation during tumorigenesis. In multiple murine models, P. copri not only accelerated tumor growth but also reprogrammed tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward a pro-tumoral state. Untargeted metabolomics revealed glycerophosphocholine (GPC) as the only conserved metabolite depleted by P. copri across murine models and bacterial cultures, a finding confirmed by spatial metabolomics in clinical specimens. Strikingly, GPC supplementation reprogrammed MARCO+ TAMs toward an anti-tumoral phenotype, effectively counteracting P. copri-mediated tumor progression. Overall, this study uncovers a paradigm in CRC pathogenesis in which P. copri creates an immunosuppressive niche by depleting GPC to manipulate macrophage polarization. These findings position P. copri as both a non-invasive diagnostic marker and druggable therapeutic target, with GPC restoration representing a promising immunometabolic intervention strategy.",

We report that the I-BAR domain-containing protein, missing-in-metastasis (MIM) (also called MTSS1), promotes branched actin network formation and endocytosis to drive rapid, cyclical plasma membrane remodeling during syncytial divisions in Drosophila embryos. Actin-rich villous protrusions in the apical caps in interphase are depleted in metaphase, concurrent with furrow extension between adjacent nuclei. MIM depletion results in a loss of furrow extension and in longer, more abundant apical protrusions containing the formin diaphanous. Branched actin networks promoted by MIM are in balance with bundled actin networks induced by RhoGEF2 and diaphanous. Cyclical recruitment of MIM to the cortex promotes localization of active Rac, the WAVE regulatory complex, and the Arp2/3 complex to drive endocytic membrane remodeling. These findings identify MIM as an integrator of actin and endocytic dynamics that enables rapid membrane remodeling during Drosophila syncytial division cycles.",

This improvement enables the accurate visualization of diverse membrane organelles and phase separations, as well as the 3D visualization of their contact sites. As a demonstration, we revealed triple-organellar contact sites among the stress granule, the nuclear tunnel, and the nucleolus. Overall, land-ExM offers a high-contrast superresolution platform that advances our understanding of how cells spatially coordinate interactions between membrane organelles and phase separations.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the brain's resident macrophages, can be reconstituted by surrogate cells - a process termed 'microglia replacement'. To expand the microglia replacement toolkit, we here introduce estrogen-regulated (ER) homeobox B8 (Hoxb8) conditionally immortalized macrophages, a cell model for generation of immune cells from murine bone marrow, as a versatile model for microglia replacement. We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this system's power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo - phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology. In sum, we introduce the ER-Hoxb8 approach to model microglia replacement and use it to clarify macrophage contributions to AGS.",

ECM stiffening leads to the collapse of blood vessels leading to oxygen deprivation and nutrient stress.

Here we show that in breast cancer cells, glucose deprivation induces a switch from an energy demanding proteolytic mode of migration to an energy efficient non-proteolytic mode of migration. Energy demands met by OXPHOS, and nuclear softening sustain this mode of migration. We further show that the energy sensor AMPK mediates this switch through transcriptional activation of the mechanoresponsive actin crosslinking protein \u03b1-actinin-4. Collectively, our results demonstrate how AMPK fine-tunes mode of invasion under nutrient constraints by transcriptional activation of \u03b1-actinin-4.",

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in FMR1 and consequent loss of the encoded protein FMRP, which results in downstream molecular, neurologic, and mitochondrial deficits that are linked to cognitive impairment. In the human postmortem brain, many metabolites and solute carrier proteins are coordinately dysregulated, which also occurs during the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into excitatory neurons. Metabolic tracing in FXS neurons demonstrates a dearth of glutamine deamidation to glutamate, which reduces anaplerosis into the TCA cycle, potentially hindering the bioenergetic and biosynthetic functions of mitochondria. Mechanistically, aberrant expression of glutaminase isoforms in FXS is responsible for reduced glutaminolysis, thereby altering glutamate levels, which may contribute to FXS.",

This suppression of IGFBP3 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in LUAD cells and amplifies the oncogenic IGF1/IGF1R/Akt/ERK signaling cascade initiated by CALF-secreted IGF1.

    "title": "Stuxnet balances mitochondria homeostasis by regulating uhg5 and parkin.",
    "abstract": "Emerging evidence implicates the Stuxnet (Stx) protein in human disease, extending beyond its known role in proteasome-independent degradation. Exploring this further, our investigation into stx downstream targets in Drosophila reveals that loss of the U snoRNA host gene 5 (Uhg5) gene disrupts sleep. This sleep phenotype is linked to inefficient translation of mitochondrial genes, as Uhg5 produces small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that directly regulate mitochondrial transcripts. Using GoldCLIP technology, we discover that Stx interacts with both Uhg5 and parkin mRNAs. parkin is a key regulator of mitochondrial quality control. Genetic tests confirm functional relationships between stx, Uhg5, and parkin. This study establishes that Uhg5-derived snoRNAs regulate sleep by controlling mitochondrial gene translation. Crucially, our findings propose a model in which Stx coordinates mitochondrial biogenesis (via Uhg5) with mitophagy (via parkin). This provides a molecular link for Stx's potential role in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "An important unsolved problem is how the brain survives in a complex world by performing a rich repertoire of computation on a minimal energy budget. Despite using a seemingly fixed architecture, the brain performs much better than current generations of computers and artificial intelligence. Neuromodulation is updating the effectiveness of signal transmission, giving rise to variable effective connectivity between regions to allow computational richness. Here, we integrate 19 empirical neurotransmitter maps as modulators of the underlying local regional dynamics in a whole-brain model of human brain activity. Our neurotransmission-modulated (NEMO) framework flexibly computes different tasks. For each individual, \"brain computability\" is defined as the ability to fit all tasks. Brain computability correlates with behavioral performance on individual tasks and with a general behavioral measure of intelligence. Overall, NEMO sculpts brain dynamics in a fixed brain architecture to compute the rich repertoire of tasks required for surviving and thriving.",

    "abstract": "Brain myeloid cells accumulate neutral lipids in multiple human neurodegenerative disorders and relevant mouse models. These lipids are often assumed to be contained in lipid droplets (LDs). While studies have been performed in cell culture and Drosophila models to characterize glial LDs, the roles of microglial LD biogenesis in mammalian tauopathy are unclear. To address this issue, we induced the deletion of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) 1 and 2, enzymes critical for LD formation, from microglia in the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy. Microglial DGAT double knockout (KO) exacerbated neurodegeneration and increased the abundance of brain cholesteryl esters in male PS19 mice. Myeloid cell lipid accumulations appeared to largely localize to endosomes/lysosomes, not LDs, at baseline and were exacerbated upon DGAT KO. Our results suggest that microglial DGAT-dependent TAG/LD biogenesis is adaptive in advanced tauopathy. Most lipid accumulation in brain myeloid cells does not appear to correspond to LDs in this tauopathy model, which has implications for the development of lipid-modulating therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although macaques and marmosets are both primates of choice for studying the brain mechanisms of cognition, they differ in key aspects of anatomy and behavior. Interestingly, a recent connectomic analysis revealed that strong top-down projections from the prefrontal cortex to the posterior parietal cortex, present in macaques and important for executive function, are absent in marmosets. Here, we propose a consensus mapping that bridges the two species' cortical atlases and allows for direct area-to-area comparison of their connectomes, which are then used to build comparative computational large-scale modeling of the frontoparietal circuit for working memory. The macaque model exhibits resilience against distractors, a prerequisite for normal working memory function. By contrast, the marmoset model predicts a sensitivity to distractibility commonly observed behaviorally in this species. Surprisingly, this contrasting trend can be swapped by rescaling intrafrontal and frontoparietal connection weights and offers a credible prediction to the marmoset's behavior in this specific task.",

Magnetoencephalography analyses uncovered dissociable neural bases: consistent sequences engaged anterior temporal and medial frontal cortices for abstract directional representations during maintenance, while inconsistent sequences preferentially reactivated item-specific representations in parietal regions. These neural patterns predicted behavioral performance, establishing a neural efficiency principle wherein the brain adaptively switches between relational and item-based coding strategies, mitigating WM constraints.

Tubular senescence drives kidney fibrosis, but current treatments do not target senescent cells. Here, we identify nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT) as a critical mediator of tubular senescence and kidney fibrosis. Human CKD microarrays link NNMT to senescence and fibrosis transcriptomic signatures, and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) biopsies show NNMT protein associating with p21, fibrosis, and kidney function decline. Spatial transcriptomics in human biopsies demonstrates that NNMT-positive tubules are senescent, fibrotic, and surrounded by a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Importantly, this pattern is conserved in aged and DKD mice, mimicking early-stage CKD features. Mechanistically, NNMT overexpression in tubular epithelial cells exacerbates senescence and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, while selective NNMT inhibition in senescent kidney cells, organoids, and in vivo is protective. Altogether, these findings position NNMT as a promising therapeutic target to reduce tubular senescence and fibrosis in early CKD.",

Our exploration of patient TME interactions preserved in HOTT highlights four receptor-ligand interactions of interest. We knock down all four of these genes in the HOTT microenvironment. We observe that knocking down nTME PTPRZ1, a receptor tyrosine phosphatase implicated in cancer cell migration, results in an increased fraction of mesenchymal cells, enrichment of epithelial-to-mesenchymal gene programs, and an elevated tumor microtube length in co-cultured primary patient tumors. This phenotype is not mediated by PTPRZ1's catalytic activity, suggesting a mechanism of tumor cell fate driven by nTME PTPRZ1, highlighting the strengths of the HOTT system.",

KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) typically repress TE-derived regulatory activity via TRIM28-mediated H3K9me3 deposition. We expand this paradigm by uncovering non-canonical KZFP-TE relationships. Through comprehensive epigenomic mapping of KZFP-bound TEs, we show that ancient mammalian L2/MIR elements' regulatory activity is delineated by KZFP binding despite low H3K9me3 enrichment. We dissect this relationship by focusing on ZNF436, a non-canonical KZFP highly expressed in the developing human heart. We find that ZNF436 preserves cardiomyocyte function by promoting cardiac gene expression while restricting alternative lineage programs. Mechanistically, ZNF436 associates with the SWI/SNF remodeling complex to limit the accessibility of L2/MIR-derived CREs, otherwise active in non-cardiac tissues. Our findings reveal a TRIM28-independent role for KZFPs in shaping cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes and emphasize the importance of repressing alternative lineage programs while activating lineage-specific ones to safeguard cell identity.",

While this transfer reshapes inflammatory microenvironments, its pathological mechanisms in peripheral inflammatory pain remain uncharacterized, impeding targeted interventions.

Inflammatory stress impairs mitophagy, leading to dysfunctional mitochondrial accumulation and heightened neuronal hyperexcitability. Mitochondria from SGCs restore mitophagic flux and enhance mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites, thereby facilitating calcium exchange and homeostasis while reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Critically, Atl1 knockout and overexpression mice models reveal that ATL1-driven ER restructuring initiates autophagosome formation during mitophagy and regulates early-stage autophagic progression. Taken together, our findings uncover a neuroprotective axis wherein glial mitochondrial donation safeguards neurons, directly nominating mitochondrial dynamics for therapeutic intervention in orofacial inflammatory pain.",

However, the mechanisms governing its nuclear translocation and functions remain incompletely understood. Here, we discover that RIG-I undergoes lactylation, which is mediated by the acetyltransferase PCAF. Treatment with the lactate transporter inhibitor syrosingopine blocks the efflux of lactate from cancer cells, increasing intracellular lactate concentration, promoting RIG-I lactylation, and enhancing the nuclear translocation of lactylated RIG-I in an importin 8-dependent manner. The nuclear-localized RIG-I interacts with PARP1 and attenuates its activity, thereby inhibiting DNA damage repair. Moreover, we find that low RIG-I expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis and survival in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Syrosingopine treatment sensitizes LUAD cells to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) and potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of olaparib in a mouse LUAD model. Altogether, our study reveals that lactylation drives RIG-I nuclear function to inhibit DNA damage repair via PARP suppression.

A prior model proposed that IcmSW are released from substrates during translocation by transfer to the C terminus of DotL and then recycled to the cytoplasm. This model predicts an excess cytoplasmic pool of IcmSW and their dissociation from DotL. We tested these predictions using quantitative stoichiometric analysis of Dot/Icm components and DotL-chaperone fusion constructs. IcmSW were present at levels comparable to DotL, and a DotL-IcmW-IcmS fusion fully complemented an \u0394icmS \u0394icmW mutant for intracellular replication.

Broad thorny cell responses are strongest when motion in the center and surround is uncorrelated, similar to object-motion-sensitive cells found in other species. A different pattern is observed in On smooth monostratified cells: surround activation is suppressive for static stimuli and facilitatory for motion.

We captured 340,000 spatial low-bulk and 530,000 spatial single-cell transcriptomes and observed a spectrum of classical-to-basal tumor subtypes present within all patients.

We defined key tumor heterogeneity features, including the presence of mixed KRAS mutations and tertiary lymphoid structures, identifying biomarkers that distinguish the latter from lymph nodes. Lastly, by leveraging patient, cell, and mouse data, we determined which aspects of tumor biology are recapitulated in bulk datasets and reductionist models.",

    "abstract": "Distinct epithelial cell states arise during differentiation, but mechanisms generating transcriptomic diversity among them remain poorly defined. The human ureter urothelium contains basal progenitor, intermediate cells, and terminally differentiated umbrella cells. Prior single-cell RNA sequencing revealed similar global gene expression profiles across these states, raising the question of how distinct identities emerge. Here, we show that alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) introduces a major layer of transcriptomic diversity during urothelial differentiation, largely independent of changes in mRNA levels. Analysis of 13,544 urothelial cells identified hundreds of differentiation-associated APA events. Single-cell imaging revealed spatially specific APA patterns, and reporter assays demonstrated gene- and context-dependent control of protein expression by alternative 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), consistent with in situ protein patterns. Conserved motifs in APA-regulated 3' UTRs, including transcription factor binding sites and Alu elements, suggest mechanisms for polyadenylation site selection. Our study establishes APA as a key contributor to transcriptomic complexity in the human urothelium.",

Although genomic islands have been extensively studied in angiosperms, the patterns of genomic divergence remain poorly understood in gymnosperms. Here, by re-sequencing the whole genome of 130 individuals of Welwitschia mirabilis, we reveal significant genomic differentiation among its geographically close populations. Population genomic analyses suggest that geographical isolation and species characteristics play important roles in triggering and maintaining population divergence. We also identify multiple genomic islands of elevated divergence, which are primarily attributed to divergent sorting of ancient polymorphisms and divergence hitchhiking. Further genome-wide association analyses indicate that Welwitschia has an XY-type sex-determination system, with the sex-linked region located at 72.04-92.82 Mb on chromosome 6. Our findings are important for comprehending the evolutionary forces shaping genomic patterns of differentiation and the genetic basis of sex determination in gymnosperms.",

Using a gene-swapping approach, we show here that both paralogs are largely interchangeable in this structure and beyond, including for fate determination, indicating that their specific requirements primarily reflect divergent evolution of their regulatory sequences rather than protein activities. This result, combined with birth-dating data and phenotyping of complementary transgenic models, where delayed onset or premature arrest of neurogenesis predictably triggers opposite changes in DRG content, highlights that somatosensory precursors' commitment to the mechano/proprioceptive or thermo/nociceptive lineage is rapidly biased but critically depends on differentiation timing. Together, these findings support a model where the dynamic spatiotemporal expression of functionally equivalent Neurog1 and Neurog2 proteins ensures a protracted neurogenic period, allowing the sequential emergence of distinct neuronal lineages.",

    "abstract": "How the brain combines information received independently by the two hemispheres is not fully understood. Here, we describe a non-reciprocal circuit for interhemispheric communication in the mouse binocular visual cortex via anatomically segregated neuronal populations. Callosal projecting neurons (CPNs) receive only weak or no callosal input, whereas callosal receiving neurons (CRNs) make only weak or no callosal projections. Both populations receive direct input from the thalamus. At the cellular level, CRNs have reduced excitability compared to non-CRNs (putative CPNs) due to higher Kv1 potassium channel expression (encoded by the KCNA2 gene), with excitability of CRNs correlating with the magnitude of callosal input. Functionally, CRNs are predominantly binocular, with binocularity correlating with callosal input, whereas non-CRNs (putative CPNs) are predominantly monocular. In summary, we find that non-reciprocal callosal projections between CPNs and CRNs together with differences in excitability shaped by callosal input underlie interhemispheric communication in binocular visual cortex.",

We find distinct anatomical and synaptic developmental signatures in ventral and intermediate CA1 downstream connectivity, with unique contributions to the prelimbic and infralimbic subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Juvenile inhibition of the ventral and intermediate CA1-mPFC pathways leads to opposing modulation of adult cognitive flexibility, establishing a sex- and pathway-specific sensitive period preceding the stabilization of CA1-mPFC synaptic transmission. Our data elucidate domain- and target-defined postnatal maturation of hippocampus efferents, indicating juvenility as a CA1-mPFC sensitive period with crucial implications for early life influences on adult cognition.",

However, the molecular drivers of BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation in AD remain poorly defined. Here, we identify angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) as a central mediator of BBB breakdown and AD progression. Transcriptomic analyses of human AD brains revealed elevated ANGPT2 expression in endothelial cells correlating with disease severity. In 5xFAD mice, endothelial-specific Angpt2 deletion reduced \u03b2-amyloid deposition, while Angpt2 overexpression via an adeno-associated viral vector exacerbated the plaque burden. Mechanistically, ANGPT2 suppression of TIE2 signaling increased vascular leakage and fibrin deposition, triggering microglial activation and neuroinflammatory responses that accelerated disease progression. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses further revealed Angpt2-driven microglial dysfunction and neuronal impairment consistent with memory deficits observed in behavioral assays. These findings establish ANGPT2 as a critical driver of BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation in AD and highlight its therapeutic potential.",

Efficient migration is critical for antitumoral T cells to locate and eliminate cancer cells. To investigate the upper limits of cell speed, we develop a hybrid stochastic-mean field model of bleb-based cell motility. Our model suggests that cell-matrix adhesion-free bleb migration is highly inefficient, challenging the feasibility of adhesion-independent migration as a primary fast mode. Instead, we show that T cells can achieve rapid migration by combining bleb formation with adhesion-based forces. Supporting our predictions, three-dimensional gel experiments confirm that T cells migrate significantly faster under adherent conditions than in adhesion-free environments. These findings highlight the mechanical constraints of T cell motility and suggest that controlled modulation of tissue adhesion could enhance immune cell infiltration into tumors. Our work provides insights into optimizing T cell-based immunotherapies and underscores that indiscriminate antifibrotic treatments may hinder infiltration.",

Distinct antibody-antigen interactions were analyzed using atomic models generated from cryo-EM maps. Mutagenesis screening revealed that off-target monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which do not compete with 10E8, bind non-MPER epitopes, and the binding of two most dominant epitopes were verified by cryo-EM. The structures of 10E8-class on-target Fabs showed binding patterns that resemble the YxFW motif in the 10E8 heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) loop. Additionally, we demonstrate that high-resolution maps can be generated from heterogeneous samples with pooled competing Fabs. Overall, our findings will facilitate the optimization of MPER-GT antigens and push the size limit for cryo-EM-based epitope mapping with smaller antigens and heterogeneous antibody mixes.",

Here, we show that in Escherichia coli, Ndk is regulated by dephosphorylation of its phosphohistidine intermediate via the phosphatase SixA, thereby inhibiting nucleotide phosphoryl transfer activity. We further show that loss of this regulation alters the metabolic state of E. coli in low-nutrient conditions and reduces survival in long-term stationary phase. Similar regulation of Ndk by a phosphohistidine phosphatase has been reported previously for human cells, although the molecular interactions differ. The prevalence of SixA and Ndk orthologs in prokaryotes and the appearance of this regulatory mechanism in both E. coli and humans suggest that phosphohistidine phosphatase-mediated control of nucleoside diphosphate kinases may be widespread.",

    "abstract": "We optogenetically mapped the function and spatial organization of inhibitory circuits formed by interneurons (INs) within the claustrum, a highly interconnected but poorly understood brain region. INs expressing parvalbumin or somatostatin attenuate claustrum output by inhibiting projection neurons (PNs), while INs expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide promote claustrum output by disinhibiting PNs. The spatial organization and degree of convergence differ for each interneuronal circuit. A computational model incorporating measured circuit properties predicts that differential inhibition of PNs by INs toggles claustrum output between cortical and subcortical brain regions and that the spatial organization of IN circuits nonlinearly filters claustrum output according to the strength and spatial distribution of excitatory input. Experimental measurements show that the claustrum spatially filters cortical input as predicted by the model. We conclude that the organization of its inhibitory circuits allows the claustrum to serve as a filter that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of signals transmitted to its downstream targets.",

Mechanistically, mTORC1 phosphorylates PDX1 at serine 61 (S61), enhancing its protein stability and transcriptional activity. A certain monogenic diabetes mutation disrupts this phosphorylation and impairs PDX1 function. To investigate its physiological role, we generated mice carrying S61A and S61E mutations, mimicking unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states. S61 phosphorylation promoted insulin expression and \u03b2 cell proliferation, leading to Western diet-induced hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and hepatic steatosis.

The first six nucleotides of the guide RNA take up the A-form conformation to facilitate pairing with the target.

The PIWI endonuclease domain is in an inactive \"un-plugged\" state, with the loop containing a catalytic residue (E671) requiring structural re-orientation for activity. Furthermore, the PIWI domain reveals a conserved pre-formed pocket that may serve to accommodate a conserved tryptophan from the interacting factor GTSF1 to promote small RNA-guided endoribonuclease activity.",

In neutrophils, unexpectedly, we detect high levels of active serine proteases even in the resting state, highlighting their potential role as pre-armed effector cells poised for rapid inflammatory responses.

    "title": "Prior high fiber intake impinges on the cellular responses of mesenteric adipose and intestinal tissues to subsequent high fat feeding.",
    "abstract": "While high-fiber diets (HfiDs) promote weight loss, their long-term efficacy is limited by rapid weight regain upon returning to high-fat diets (HFDs). Using C57BL/6J mice in diet-switching paradigms, we characterized tissue-specific responses to HfiD-to-HFD transitions through single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics. HfiD pre-feeding enhanced mesenteric white adipose tissue progenitor/adipocyte sensitivity to subsequent HFD exposure. In the intestine, HfiD prevented HFD-induced immune-enterocyte expansion in the duodenum and reversed the enterocyte-to-goblet cell shift in the colon while maintaining persistent epigenetic reprogramming. Although HfiD-induced microbiome changes were largely reversed by HFD, we identified sexually dimorphic remodeling of adipose cell populations during diet transitions. Our findings demonstrate that prior HfiD feeding fundamentally reprograms adipose and intestinal responses to subsequent HFD challenge, providing mechanistic insights into dietary intervention outcomes. This work establishes a spatiotemporal resource for understanding tissue plasticity during dietary changes, offering new perspectives for obesity management strategies.",

    "abstract": "The levels of N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified RNAs are reduced within cells with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in comparison to normal cells. These reduced m6A levels stabilize RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops), whose regulation is critical for viral replication. HPV E6 induces the degradation of the m6A methyltransferases, Mettl3 and Mettl14, in an E6AP-dependent manner to reduce m6A levels, while the RNA helicase senataxin (SETX) counteracts this by activating the expression of m6A regulators. Maintenance of the residual m6A levels in undifferentiated cells is also critical for viral replication. A subset of early viral transcripts is m6A modified, and the inhibition of Mettl3 impairs viral gene expression. Upon differentiation, the levels of SETX and m6A are increased by over 8-fold, which is necessary for the productive replication of HPVs. These studies identify a role for SETX and E6 in regulating m6A deposition to control HPV pathogenesis in a differentiation-dependent manner.",

This complex has been physically and mechanistically linked to double-strand break (DSB) repair, but its role in that process remains undefined. Here, we show that the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer dynamically interacts with open chromatin regions, including transient DSB-induced open chromatin, where it can be stabilized through co-activation by the DNA repair kinase ATM and the Fanconi anemia core ubiquitin ligase. The loaded FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer stabilizes open chromatin and promotes resection and loading of RPA through increased association of BRCA1 and BLM. Chromatin-loaded FANCD2-FANCI has a second, distinct function promoting a G2 cell cycle arrest that is dependent on the ATR-CHK1-WEE1 axis. Our results support a two-step genome surveillance model in which FANCD2-FANCI monitors open chromatin sites and is stably loaded to coordinate DNA repair activities in response to signaling from a DNA repair kinase.",

    "abstract": "A major obstacle to identifying effective therapies for the aggressive brain tumor glioblastoma is the lack of human-specific, immunocompetent models that reflect the human tumor microenvironment. To address this, we developed the immune-human organoid tumor transplantation (iHOTT) model, an autologous co-culture platform that integrates patient-derived tumor cells and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells within human cortical organoids to enable the study of patient-specific immune responses and tumor-immune interactions. This platform preserves tumor and immune populations, immune signaling, and cell-cell interactions observed in patient tumors. Treatment of iHOTT with pembrolizumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, mirrors cell-type shifts and cell-cell interactions observed in patients. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing further reveals pembrolizumab-driven expansion of stem-like CD4 T cell clonotypes exhibiting patient-specific repertoires. These findings establish iHOTT as a physiologically relevant platform for exploring autologous tumor-immune interactions and underscore the need for antigen-targeted strategies to enhance immunotherapy in glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "The function of the mammalian neocortex relies on the timing of axon extension and establishment of cell-type-biased patterns of excitatory synaptic connections. A subtype of excitatory neurons, layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6CThNs), ultimately exhibits a marked preference for synapsing onto parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory interneurons over more common excitatory cells in layers 6 and 4 (L6, L4). We show that the intracortical axons of L6CThNs develop in phases, first elongating within L6, then pausing before extending translaminar branches into L4. Decreasing L6CThN excitability selectively enhances axon growth in L6 but not the later elaboration in L4. For both layers, we test whether preferential synaptogenesis onto rarer PV interneurons, or non-selective synapse formation followed by selective pruning, generates adult connectivity. We find that L6CThNs form functional AMPA-receptor-containing synapses preferentially onto PV interneurons. Silent L6CThN synapses are not detected. Our findings show that cell-type-biased synaptogenesis underlies the formation of functional cell-type-specific excitatory connections in the neocortex.",

Understanding the impact of this heterogeneity has been challenging due to the absence of systems that recapitulate this heterogeneity in vitro. Here, we found that human liver cholangiocyte organoids do not retain the complex cellular heterogeneity of the native ductal epithelium. Inspired by the knowledge of the cellular niche, we refined our previous organoid medium to fully capture the in vivo cellular heterogeneity. We employed this refined system to analyze the relationships between human biliary epithelial cell states. In our refined model, cholangiocytes transition toward hepatocyte-like states through a bipotent state. Additionally, inhibiting WNT signaling enhances the differentiation capacity of the cells toward hepatocyte-like states. By capturing the in vivo cholangiocyte heterogeneity, our improved organoid model represents a platform to investigate the impact of the different liver ductal cell states in cell plasticity, regeneration, and disease.",

    "abstract": "The five pseudo-response regulators (PRRs) in Arabidopsis are key transcriptional repressors in regulating the circadian clock, yet the mechanisms by which they cooperate to maintain circadian homeostasis and adapt to environmental changes remains unclear. We show that PRR9, PRR5, and TOC1 have interchangeable roles in determining circadian pace through promoter swapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. PRRs form homodimers and heterodimers with sequential rhythms lasting approximately 12 h, with the pseudo-receiver (PR), ethylene-responsive element-binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression motif (EAR), and C-terminal CONSTANS, CONSTANS-like, and TOC1 motif (CCT) domains being essential for dimer formation. These interactions coincide with extended periods of high protein abundance and are essential for sustaining the 24-h circadian oscillation. Based on these dynamics, we propose a \"PRR escapement\" model that explains the diverse circadian periods of prr mutants. Additionally, PRRs rapidly respond to environmental cues, such as light and temperature, adjusting transcription and protein-complex assembly to align growth with environmental changes.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals human glial progenitor populations and dynamic stages of astroglial development resembling those in the human brain. Cell-cell communication analysis identifies strong human neural interactions, including NRXN-NLGN3 signaling between neurons and astrocytes and SPP1- and PTN-MK-mediated communication between microglia and astroglia.

While the roles of ADPr transferases such as PARP1/2 and TNKS1/2 are well established, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of ADPr hydrolases are still poorly understood. Here, we identify a function of the poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase PARG in regulating protein degradation. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that PARG inhibition depletes protein levels of the mono-ADPr hydrolase TARG1. We demonstrate that this TARG1 depletion is both PAR and proteasome dependent and identify the E3 ubiquitin ligases HUWE1 and TRIP12 as mediators of this process. Our findings establish TARG1 as a substrate of PAR-dependent protein degradation and uncover a PARG-dependent mechanism controlling its stability.

Here, we found that Gly transporters support interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) production in inflammatory macrophages, while Gly receptors inhibit it. Inflammatory macrophages have higher expression of Gly transporter 1 (GlyT1; also known as SLC6A9). Notably, SLC6A9 inhibition leads to extracellular accumulation of Gly and limits IL-1\u03b2 production in inflammatory macrophages. Mechanically, extracellular Gly suppresses phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT1)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling through the Gly receptor alpha-4 (Glr\u03b14), thereby inhibiting activation of the NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and IL-1\u03b2 production. Furthermore, Gly supplementation or myeloid-specific SLC6A9 depletion alleviates the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized mechanism for the Gly-ergic system in regulating inflammatory macrophage function, providing a potential alleviating target for macrophage-associated diseases.",

The chromatin features of the signature are detectable in residual tumors after treatment and in treatment-naive tumors from patients who later develop resistance. Further, the signature independently predicts chemotherapy response in metastatic HGSOC and patient-derived xenograft models. Cells enriched in the persister state display a subset of genes primed for expression before treatment, an altered cell cycle, and stress-response programs associated with poor clinical outcomes.

Chronic activation of the innate immune response in chondrocytes plays a key role in OA progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) exacerbates cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in OA. MAVS activation is observed in chondrocytes from both OA patients and the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model. Both constitutive and chondrocyte-specific MAVS knockout alleviate cartilage degradation, osteophyte formation, subchondral bone remodeling, and synovitis in DMM mice. Conversely, MAVS overexpression aggravates these OA phenotypes. Mechanistically, cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA in chondrocytes triggers MAVS activation, leading to MAVS-nuclear factor \u03baB-dependent ECM degradation by inducing matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and MMP13. Pharmacologically blocking MAVS using L-lactate significantly attenuates ECM degradation and OA progression. These findings suggest that MAVS signaling is critical in OA pathogenesis and may be a potential therapeutic target for OA treatment.",

These proteins often function by altering the cell surface and preventing phages from attaching to their host receptor. Here, we describe prophage-encoded proteins that resemble FimU, a component of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pilus. These phage FimU proteins are incorporated into the pilus without altering its function, yet they mediate robust protection against infection by phages that bind to the tip of the pilus, where FimU is located. The phage FimU proteins and the phage tail proteins that likely interact with FimU are highly diverse, suggesting that evolution in this system is driven by phage versus phage competition. These phage FimU proteins represent an example of anti-phage defense mediated by the replacement of a bacterial cell surface component with a phage-encoded protein.",

Analyses reveal that epithelial and microenvironment (TME) states are transcriptionally distinct between groups. Invasive GPx epithelia show an increase in immune transcripts, with a more immune-rich TME (via IF). PPx epithelia, in contrast, are more metabolically and translationally active, with a mesenchymal/fibrotic TME. Pre-cancerous epithelia in PPx exhibit a presence of aggressiveness, marked by increased EMT signaling and complement activity. We identify distinct epithelial gene signatures for PPx and GPx that can accurately classify diagnostic samples and likely inform therapy.",

This review aims to examine how progenitors and stem cells generate diverse fates through multilineage priming and the competitive interplay of biasing gene-expression programs. Microheterogeneity among progenitors, combined with differential fate biases, gives rise to cell populations with collective multipotency, an emergent state in which the population self-regulates to balance the production of all downstream fates during embryogenesis. We discuss how progenitor cells navigate the epigenetic landscape to control descendant cell-type proportions and how multilineage priming helps reconcile inductive, communication-driven modes of development with autonomous, self-intrinsic fate selection. In parallel, we review computational approaches that leverage single-cell transcriptomics, clonal lineage tracing, and multiomics integration to reconstruct developmental trajectories, identify biases, and dissect the mechanisms of fate selection and commitment.",

Using untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics, we identified hippuric acid-an aromatic, microbe-derived metabolite-as a potent enhancer of inflammatory responses during Escherichia coli infection. Hippuric acid administration heightened inflammation, activated innate immune cells, and reduced survival in infected mice. In vitro, hippuric acid selectively potentiated M1-like (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] or LPS+interferon gamma [IFN\u03b3]) macrophage pro-inflammatory responses but had no effect on M2-like (interleukin [IL]-4) polarization. It enhanced responses to myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands but not TRIF-, STING-, or NOD2-mediated stimuli. Genetic deletion of MyD88 abolished hippuric-acid-induced pro-inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed increased cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid accumulation, while reducing cellular cholesterol blunted the pro-inflammatory effects of hippuric acid. Notably, hippuric acid also enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in human macrophages, and its elevated levels correlated with sepsis mortality, linking microbial metabolism, lipid remodeling, and innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) shows considerable intratumoral heterogeneity, which contributes to therapeutic resistance. Recent studies show that targeted therapeutics can steer TNBC toward homogeneous, drug-resistant states, but little is understood about how the microenvironment modulates these responses. We report studies to determine how components of the microenvironment impact response to trametinib and cellular heterogeneity. We find that multiple microenvironmental factors, including HGF and neuregulin 1, can drive therapeutic resistance and that treatment with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibitors restores trametinib sensitivity. Interestingly, treatment with these ligands reverses trametinib-induced homogeneity, restoring heterogeneity to levels comparable to baseline both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of patient data demonstrates that TNBC with high HGF expression levels has a poor outcome and increased expression of basal and mesenchymal state markers. Our data suggest that common growth factors drive therapeutic resistance and maintain tumor heterogeneity in TNBC, and that co-targeting these factors may improve therapeutic response.",

We define the structural and functional diversity of Caenorhabditis elegans PEZO-1, a single gene with extensive alternative splicing, by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of three representative isoforms: G (full length), K (lacking the pore-distal N-terminal blade), and L (missing most of the blade). PEZO-1G displays mechanically evoked currents yet adopts a compact, semi-flattened conformation that significantly differs from the mammalian domes. The blades exhibit a three-step slope architecture stabilized by inter-blade latching among transmembrane helical units, yielding a circular, steering-wheel-like arrangement. A wider cap enables distinct blade-cap contacts that stabilize a \"toggle-down\" conformation. Isoform K also exhibits mechanically evoked currents, indicating that the pore-distal N-terminal blade is dispensable for mechanoactivation. Computational membrane-deformation modeling indicates that the isoforms impose distinct curvatures on the bilayer. Our findings indicate an evolutionarily distinct architecture for PEZO-1.",

To address this issue, we use electrocorticography to directly measure the brains of neurosurgical participants performing an interactive speech paradigm. We observe a broad range of cortical modulation profiles, and subsequent clustering analyses establish that responses comprised distinct classes associated with sensory perception, planning, motor execution, and task-related suppression. These activity classes are also localized to separate neural substrates, indicating their status as specialized networks. We then parse dynamics in the planning and motor networks using unsupervised dimensionality reduction, which reveals subnetworks that are sequentially active throughout preparation and articulation. These results therefore support and extend a localizationist model of speech production where cortical activity \"flows\" within and across discrete pathways during language use.",

We found that cardiac muscle has the highest rate of protein turnover, followed by slow-twitch skeletal muscle and then fast-twitch skeletal muscle, and that these different rates of protein turnover are driven by different levels of muscle use, rather than myosin isoform composition. We also identified protein age heterogeneity at the myofiber and sarcomere levels. These findings uncover fundamental principles of muscle protein maintenance and have broad implications for understanding cellular aging, muscle disease, and the design of therapeutic strategies targeting muscle protein turnover.",

Staphylococci also carry type II and III CRISPR-Cas systems that mount an adaptive immune response against phages through the acquisition of spacer sequences from viral genomes, directing Cas nucleases to their targets. Whether and how SaPIs and CRISPR interact with each other during helper phage infection is not known. Here we report that, as a result of the packaging of incomplete helper phage genomes into SaPI particles, defective viral DNA delivered into new hosts stimulates spacer acquisition in both CRISPR types. Once immunized, staphylococci target the helper phage and prevent SaPI mobilization. Our work reveals an unexpected synergy between CRISPR-Cas systems and SaPIs that enhances antiphage immunity and could favor the retention of beneficial elements within the population.",

Although prior work has identified motor cortical tuning to low-level kinematic features like velocity and position, these findings fall short of explaining the precision underlying complex motor behaviors. Critically, it remains unclear whether and how the motor cortex (MC) represents higher-level features of movement. Using single-unit recordings from the human MC during handwriting, we employed surrogate deep neural networks (DNNs) as a tool to investigate these mechanisms. We found that surrogate DNNs capture key aspects of neural activity at both single-unit and population levels. Through this approach, we demonstrate that the MC encodes hierarchical information of movement, including both low-level kinematics and high-level features related to the written content. These results uncover neural encoding behind dexterous motor execution and provide a framework for studying the neural basis of complex behavior.",

IGHV3-53/66 antibodies from infection-naive vaccinees frequently neutralize Omicron variants and contain hallmark breadth-enhancing mutations. While Omicron breakthrough infection does not alter IGHV3-53/66 mutation frequencies, it modifies Ig light-chain pairing frequencies, suggesting variant-driven selection for favorable pairings. Structural analyses of IGHV3-53/66-RBD complexes show that hallmark heavy-chain mutations refine interactions with conserved RBD residues, while alternative Ig light-chain pairings modify contacts at Omicron mutation sites.

The p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) regulates endothelial cell (EC) migration, an essential step in angiogenesis, yet its role in tumor angiogenesis remains ill-defined. Here, we show that endothelial-specific deletion of PAK2 in orthotopic tumor mouse models markedly reduces tumor size and angiogenesis. Additionally, loss of endothelial PAK2 normalizes the remaining tumor vasculature and promotes infiltration of dendritic and natural killer cells. Mechanistically, PAK2 regulates chemokine expression, notably CXCL10. PAK2 depletion enhances CXCL10 secretion from ECs, and CXCL10 expression is required for the inhibitory effects of PAK2 silencing on EC sprouting. Moreover, CXCL10 neutralization in mice reverses the vascular and immune changes induced by endothelial PAK2 deletion. Together, these findings identify endothelial PAK2 as a potential target to limit tumor angiogenesis and reprogram ECs to promote immune infiltration through CXCL10 signaling.",

Lagged general linear modeling uncovered hierarchical information flow from the thalamus to the parahippocampal cortex and hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus, CA1-CA3). This speed-CBV relationship showed sharp spatial specificity to navigation structures. Multivariate decoding demonstrated that CBV signals carry highly accurate encodings of locomotion speed, remaining robust across animals. We also identified slow CBV oscillations aligned with exploratory behavior fluctuations. These findings reveal a hemodynamic signature of speed representation arising from energy demands in continuous attractor networks, where population activity scales quadratically with speed, and establish fUS imaging as a powerful tool for investigating the neurovascular basis of navigation.",

Following ischemic stroke, loss- and gain-of-function analyses revealed that these cells are reactivated and recruited toward injured vascular endothelium via SDF1\u03b1-CXCR4 signaling; undergo stromal cell transition within the perivascular niche, regulated by \u03b2-catenin and STAT3 pathways; and restore vascular integrity through pleiotrophin-mediated signaling.

Herein, we explored the functional role of spindle and nucleolar protein 6 (NOL6) in CRC progression. In this study, we found that NOL6 was significantly overexpressed in CRC tissues and correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor patient prognosis. Mechanistically, NOL6 recruited the deubiquitinating enzyme STAMBP to remove K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from Yin Yang 1 (YY1) at lysine 339, preventing YY1 degradation and enhancing c-Myc transcription. A feedback loop was identified where c-Myc directly bound to the NOL6 promoter, reinforcing NOL6 expression. Additionally, lactylation at lysine 54 (K54) of NOL6 stabilized NOL6 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Targeting NOL6-K54 lactylation with a cell-penetrating peptide inhibitor (K54-pe4) suppressed CRC cell proliferation and metastases in vivo without apparent toxicity. These findings establish a novel regulatory axis (NOL6-STAMBP-YY1-Myc) strengthened by lactylation, highlighting NOL6 as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.",

While the dominance of Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R)-activating IgG subclasses has been observed in both human and murine LN, whether this imbalance is causal or merely correlative remains unresolved. To address this, we generated a murine model that exclusively expresses the activating IgG2c while lacking all other IgG subclasses. Despite preserved B cell receptor diversity and intact humoral immunity, these mice developed rapidly progressive and fatal lupus-like nephritis, with 100% mortality by 30 weeks, characterized by extensive renal inflammation. Genetic ablation of Fc\u03b3Rs or complement C3 rescued this phenotype, establishing both as essential and non-redundant mediators of disease. Supporting clinical relevance, renal biopsies from patients with LN exhibited glomerular immune deposits enriched for Fc\u03b3R-activating IgG1 and minimal inhibitory IgG4. Together, these results identify IgG subclass dominance as a direct driver of LN and provide a fully penetrant, rapid-onset disease model for therapeutic studies.",

In this context, the translocation of intestinal bacteriophages (phages) and their effects on the host haven't been fully investigated. We use phage fluorescence imaging coupled with ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models that mimic physiological and inflammatory conditions and find that phages can translocate across the intestinal barrier without disrupting its integrity. While changes in the epithelial barrier integrity selectively impact phage translocation rates, alterations in the permeability of the vascular endothelium do not affect phage crossing. Virome analysis confirms that viral sequences shared between the blood and fecal samples of patients with Crohn's disease are more abundant than in healthy subjects, suggesting that a barrier defect facilitates intestinal phage translocation.",

AMG517 and AMG9810 are deeply situated within the S3-S4 interface of the vanilloid pocket, where they interact with residues from the S3-S6 helices, as well as the S4-S5 linker. These interactions induce local deformations in the TRP-box and lower S6 helix, accompanied by a modest rotation of the S1-S4 bundle, leading to partial dilation of the lower gate.

High-throughput screening of the Prestwick library against these fascia explants identified drugs modulating these behaviors, revealing a spectrum from fibrosis to scarless healing. Recovery phenotypes correlated with fibroblast sprouting, reticulation, and clustering rather than traditional extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition markers. We identified two therapeutic categories: compounds disrupting reticulation/clustering that inhibit scarring and compounds (fluvastatin, thiostrepton, fenbendazole) disrupting sprouting that blocked pro-inflammatory fibroblast/myofibroblast commitment, promoted angiogenesis, reduced inflammatory infiltration, and enabled scar-free regenerative healing with hair follicle papillae regrowth in mice.

In this study, we employed a proteogenomic approach using long-read RNA-seq with Pacific Biosciences Single-Molecule Real-Time Sequencing technology to analyze full-length transcripts in combination with the human leukocyte antigen ligandome. As a result, many neoantigen candidates were identified, which were unregistered in a comprehensive database, including those from non-coding regions. Additionally, we validated the responses of specific T cell receptors (TCRs) to these candidates and identified several pairs of TCRs and neoantigens.

Leveraging this toolkit, we systematically dissected plasmid-dependent methylotrophy, restriction-modification machinery, and the functional significance of chromosomal methylotrophic genes. To address plasmid loss-induced strain degeneration, we integrated the large endogenous plasmid pBM19 into the chromosome for stable and intact methylotrophic growth. Finally, by integrating metabolic modeling with CRISPR-Cas9 editing, we engineered L-arginine feedback regulation to achieve L-arginine overproduction from methanol.

    "abstract": "Maternal diet is critical in shaping neonatal metabolism and long-term health by governing breast milk composition. Although bile acids are present in breast milk, their functional role in infant development is not well understood. We identify enteromammary trafficking as the primary source of milk bile acids and show that this pool is modifiable by maternal diet. We also find that maternal bile acids regulate infant growth and levels of the growth-promoting hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Remarkably, maternal bile acid sequestration completely prevents excess weight gain in offspring nursed by dams on a high-fat diet. Supplementation with a bile acid or an agonist of the bile acid receptor TGR5 restores growth. Furthermore, TGR5-deficient pups phenocopy the maternal sequestration phenotype, supporting the model that maternal milk bile acids activate neonatal TGR5 to promote infant growth. Altogether, these findings reveal milk bile acids as active metabolic signals with potential for nutritional intervention in early-life programming.",

Brain-wide mapping of SPN projections revealed distinct subtype-dependent projection patterns. The existence of GABAergic SPNs was further demonstrated by single-neuron projectome analysis and electrophysiological recording of inhibitory spinal inputs at target brain areas. Using gene set-based classification, we identified coherent expression of functional gene modules across SPN subtypes, supporting their transcriptional distinction and functional specialization. Finally, distinct SPN subtypes were shown to be differentially involved in pain and itch processing.

We found that, when averaged across all neurons, persistent delay activity was observable throughout the duration of single trials in populations of prefrontal neurons with silent periods that did not deviate significantly from chance. However, temporal fluctuations in activity-dependent mnemonic information were present and weakly correlated between the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices, suggesting at least partial, long-distance synchronization of off states. The decoding accuracy of neurons recorded simultaneously was also reduced relative to pseudo-populations constructed by splicing different trials together. Our results support an asynchronous state of working memory, maintained by the distributed activity patterns, which is subject to widely distributed fluctuations in information representation fidelity.",

With semi-automated cellular reconstructions and automated synaptic mapping of all cells, we identify the precise synaptic connections and the astroglia, including bona fide astrocytes, that physically associate with those synapses. Tripartite synapses are equally distributed across the circuit, and singular astroglia interact multiple times within a single circuit and across circuits. Using this ultrastructural map, we model synaptic thresholding and glial modulation on information flow. We validate this mapping by imaging neurons and glia with GCaMP6s.

Using BTV as a model, we reveal that ZAP inhibits replication via two mechanisms: (1) ZAP interacts with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A to block elongation during viral protein synthesis and (2) it binds preferentially to negative-sense RNA strands to stimulate their degradation. Additionally, BTV-NS1, encoded by segment 5, antagonizes ZAP by impairing its RNA-binding ability. Notably, synonymous CpG enrichment in BTV segment 5 significantly attenuated viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings uncover a dynamic interplay between ZAP and dsRNA viruses and suggest CpG-elevated BTV as a potential live-attenuated vaccine candidate.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have uncovered a number of functional RNA structures in RNA viruses, yet their regulatory roles remain poorly understood. Here, using an unbiased proteomic approach alongside targeted biochemical assays, we investigate a previously uncharacterized functional pseudoknot (pk1) within the hepatitis C virus coding region and show that it stably interacts with host ribosomes, inhibiting translation and potentially acting as a regulator between viral translation and RNA genome replication. Comparative structural analysis identifies pk1-like elements in related RNA viruses, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism. This study expands the known functions of pseudoknots in viral coding regions beyond frameshifting, highlights the critical role of RNA structure-mediated regulation within viral open reading frames, and provides insight into the design of viral therapeutics and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Rhizoid specification in Marchantia polymorpha gemmae involves lateral inhibition mediated by the microRNA FRH1, which represses the rhizoid-specific transcription factor RSL1. Accordingly, rhizoid precursor cells appear isolated or spatially organized into small linear clusters. Yet, the molecular mechanisms driving this patterning remain unclear. Using mathematical modeling, we show that rhizoid patterning is consistent with local activation of RSL1, modulated by lateral inhibition through FRH1 diffusion. Our results suggest that rhizoid precursor cells are initiated stochastically and refined by lateral inhibition via a diffusion-driven switch, in which FRH1 mobility generates a sharp transition between spatially uniform and patterned states. These patterns are associated with a subcritical Turing bifurcation and naturally occur at criticality. Combining published and original data, we show that our model can reproduce the spatial statistics of wild-type and mutant phenotypes. Our work highlights a patterning mechanism underlying cellular differentiation and tissue morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal responses to stimuli rely on transcriptional programs controlled by histone proteins, including histone variants. Recent findings demonstrate that the variant H2BE promotes transcription and is critical for long-term memory, which relies on intact activity-dependent responses. However, whether H2BE is regulated by synaptic stimuli and controls activity-dependent responses remains to be determined. Here, we demonstrate that, unlike other variants, H2BE is depleted following long-term but not short-term increases in activity, indicating that its loss may promote homeostatic downscaling. Neurons lacking H2BE are unable to mount proper long-term activity-dependent transcriptional responses both in cultured neurons and in animal models. Lastly, we demonstrate that H2BE-knockout neurons fail to undergo the electrophysiological changes associated with homeostatic plasticity. In summary, these data demonstrate that H2BE expression is inversely correlated with activity and is necessary for long-term activity-dependent scaling responses, revealing a mechanism through which histone variants control homeostatic plasticity in neurons.",

We use human cortical organoids (COs) and ganglionic eminence organoids (GEOs) to model poly-alanine expansion (PAE) mutations in ARX. PAE mutations increase cortical progenitor proliferation and accelerate early cortical development.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from multiple studies, we integrate data to identify key gene co-expression modules, transposable element expression, and biological processes recapitulated in 8CLCs. We identify both mature and intermediate 8CLCs, with the Yoshihara and Mazid datasets best representing 8C embryos. 8CLCs show remodeling in energy and RNA metabolism, regulation of RNA splicing, and ribosome biogenesis, mirroring human 8C embryos.

SCA1 Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] (Pcp2-82Q) mice designed to express ataxin-1 (ATXN1)-polyGln in Purkinje cells show sense and antisense RAN protein aggregates throughout the cerebellum. Disrupting the ATXN182Q:capicua binding, which improves behavior and neuropathology, also reduces RAN protein aggregates.

    "abstract": "The African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a significant threat to the global swine industry, with no effective vaccine available. ASFV subverts cellular processes, including programmed cell death mechanisms, to enhance its transmission and pathogenicity. Here, we show that the ASFV p54 manipulates the secretory carrier membrane protein 3 (SCAMP3)-dependent apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) pathway to facilitate cell-cell transmission, thereby enhancing viral replication. We demonstrate that p54 interacts with SCAMP3 via its carboxyl-terminal 150-184 amino acids, which is critical for the formation of ApoBDs induced by ASFV. Deletion of this motif in ASFV significantly impairs the release of virions, leading to intracellular viral accumulation and triggering ferroptosis instead of apoptosis. This shift in cell death mechanism significantly reduces virulence and provides protection against lethal challenges with wild-type ASFV. Our findings reveal a mechanism of ASFV-induced cell death and intercellular transmission, providing a theoretical foundation for developing future vaccine strategies against ASFV.",

This intricate process is further complicated by the characteristic architecture of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) maintains the stability of crista junctions that connect the cristae, the site of mitochondrial respiration, with the inner boundary membrane, where newly imported respiratory subunits first arrive. Here, we report that MICOS facilitates specific assembly steps of CIV and associates with intermediates of the Cox1 and Cox3 modules. Moreover, MICOS recruits a variety of assembly factors even in the absence of ongoing CIV biogenesis, directly or via the mitochondrial multifunctional assembly (MIMAS). Our results establish MICOS as an important agent in efficient respiratory chain assembly that promotes CIV biogenesis within the compartmentalized inner membrane architecture.",

In a mouse tumor model, wild-type IL-12 induces NK cell hyperactivation and cytokine storm followed by rapid NK cell loss. To avoid NK hyperactivation, we engineered an IL-12-Fc with attenuated IL-12R\u03b21 binding (STK-026) to preferentially target activated T cells expressing high levels of IL-12 receptors. STK-026 avoids NK cell hyperactivation but supports sustained T cell activation, interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) production, and intratumoral infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), macrophages, and cytotoxic NK cells. STK-026 induces tumor control in immune-competent mice, with a substantial therapeutic window between efficacy and toxicity. STK-026 also controls \"cold\" tumors and synergizes with anti-PD-1 treatment. In non-human primates, STK-026 avoids toxicity associated with IL-12 treatment but sustains effector T cell and NK cell activation. In summary, STK-026 provides anti-tumor efficacy without acute toxicity, expanding the therapeutic index of IL-12 treatment.",

In Arabidopsis, the root cap cuticle of primary roots has a distinct composition that includes ester-bound unsubstituted very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and ester-bound oxygenated C16/C18 fatty acids. We show that the incorporation of C26/C28 VLCFAs depends on the sn2-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase GPAT2. Loss of GPAT2 increases cuticle permeability and enhances mucilage attachment while only moderately altering cuticle ultrastructure. In contrast, loss of the long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase LACS2-which functions with GPAT4 and GPAT8 to incorporate only oxygenated fatty acids into cutin-causes severe ultrastructural and barrier defects but has little effect on mucilage attachment. These findings reveal two largely independent pathways-GPAT2 dependent and LACS2/GPAT4/GPAT8 dependent-that differentially shape root cap cuticle structure and barrier function.

Gut-specific Piezo1-knockout mice developed more tumors following CRC induction. Similarly, Piezo1-deficient CRC cell lines exhibited increased proliferation with upregulated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.

Quiescent NSCs can resume proliferation in response to different physiological stimuli. Reactivation requires changes in gene expression, much of which is regulated at the epigenomic level. We mapped epigenomic changes in NSC chromatin during stem cell quiescence and reactivation in Drosophila in vivo. Contrary to expectations, chromatin accessibility is increased in quiescent NSCs. Surprisingly, genes crucial for cell-cycle progression are repressed while remaining within permissive H3K36me3-bound euchromatin. At the same time, genes necessary for cell-cell communication are derepressed by eviction of histone H1 and transition to an SWI/SNF-enriched active state. Our results reveal global expansion of accessible chromatin in quiescent NSCs without concomitant transcriptional activation. Strikingly, this process reverses upon reactivation, indicating that opening of chromatin is a quiescence-specific event.",

    "abstract": "Collective behavior emerges from socially interacting individuals. Across species, the social behavior of healthy adults is often not present in immature animals, in socially isolated animals, or in animals with certain genetic perturbations, including models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although social behavior is impaired in all these conditions, it remains unclear whether they act through shared or distinct genetic pathways. Here, we investigate the genetic regulators of collective schooling behavior in Danionella cerebrum, by applying RNA sequencing to the brains of animals with impaired or immature social behavior: juvenile animals, socially isolated adults, and ASD-related gene crispants. By comparing gene expression to controls, we identify a small set of differentially expressed genes common to these conditions, including thyroid signaling pathway, circadian rhythm-regulating genes, the transcription factor klf9, and the ATPase subunit atp1a1a.4. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations confirm their functional importance, demonstrating convergent molecular pathways regulating social interactions and collective behavior.",

Although early efforts to enhance immunotherapy focused on boosting immune effector function, reversing T cell exhaustion, or altering the tumor microenvironment, it is now clear that cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms play a major role in immune escape. Such programs, driven by the cancer cell genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, include desensitization to cytokine signaling, such as interferon (IFN)\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF); impaired antigen presentation; upregulation of suppressive ligands such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1); and epigenetic silencing of immunogenic pathways.

Inherited mutations in genes encoding ubiquitous RNases are associated with human diseases, primarily affecting the nervous system. Recessive mutations in genes encoding the evolutionarily conserved RNA exosome, an RNase complex, cause syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders, such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1b (PCH1b), characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. Here, we establish a CRISPR-Cas9-engineered Drosophila model of PCH1b to investigate the cell-type-specific post-transcriptional regulatory functions of the RNA exosome complex in vivo. Pathogenic variants in Rrp40, a subunit of the complex, disrupt RNA exosome activity, leading to widespread transcriptomic dysregulation in brain-enriched cell populations, including defective rRNA processing. These molecular defects coincide with progressive neurodegeneration and behavioral impairments that track with allele severity. Our findings provide a cell-type-resolved view of RNA exosome function in a fully developed animal brain and underscore the critical role of RNA surveillance in safeguarding transcriptome homeostasis and neuronal integrity.",

However, the precise control of the cGAS/STRING pathway remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the ion channel TRPV2 regulates both the dormancy and activation of STRING.

In Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelium, impaired pore formation is linked to glaucoma, but the underlying processes remain poorly understood due to a lack of in vitro assays. Here, we present a platform to study pore formation in human endothelial cells. Pores were induced in SC cells by seeding them atop micron-sized magnetic beads and applying a magnetic field to generate basal-to-apical forces, mimicking in vivo biomechanics. Pore formation was dynamic, with pores opening and closing. Glaucomatous cells showed impaired pore formation, which correlated with increased stiffness. Notably, apical-to-basal forces failed to induce pores in SC cells but triggered pore formation in other endothelial types. These findings highlight the central role of cell mechanics in transcellular pore formation and provide an approach to investigate the mechanisms underlying this process.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial proteostasis is essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance, yet how proteolytic regulation coordinates with metabolic pathways remains unclear. Here, we identify Afg3l2 as a key regulator of cobalamin metabolism and amino acid homeostasis in HSCs through its mediation of Mmadhc degradation. Loss of Afg3l2 leads to Mmadhc accumulation, driving excessive mitochondrial cobalamin import and its conversion to adenosylcobalamin. Elevated adenosylcobalamin levels hyperactivate methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, diverting branched-chain amino acid catabolism toward excessive succinyl-CoA production. This overstimulates the tricarboxylic acid cycle and creates a compensatory dependency on anaplerotic amino acid replenishment. Consequently, Afg3l2-deficient HSCs exhibit increased oxidative stress due to mitochondrial hyperactivation and reactive oxygen species accumulation, ultimately impairing their maintenance and engraftment capacity. Remarkably, Mmadhc overexpression phenocopies these defects, whereas Mmadhc knockdown partially restores HSC function in Afg3l2-deficient models. Our work defines a proteostatic-metabolic circuit in which Afg3l2-mediated Mmadhc degradation regulates cobalamin flux to maintain amino acid and energy balance in HSCs.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with environmental fluctuations, yet climate change increasingly exposes them to prolonged and extreme conditions. Here, we show that sustained high humidity disrupts reproductive organ development in Arabidopsis thaliana at multiple stages. It impairs anther dehiscence and compromises pollen and stigma function, reducing seed set. In seedpods, high humidity inhibits de novo cuticle formation, allowing water infiltration and causing seed abortion. At the molecular level, high humidity reversibly downregulates the epidermal regulator ATML1 via ethylene signaling, disrupting epidermal specification in both seedpods and inflorescence meristems. This loss leads to meristem arrest and systemic changes in reproductive architecture, partly through altered cytokinin signaling. Together, these findings demonstrate atmospheric humidity acts not only as an environmental stressor but also as a reversible developmental cue, revealing humidity as an underappreciated regulatory layer in plant reproduction with implications for crop resilience under climate change.",

Mechanistic insights into the oncogenic driver potential of aneuploidy require improved experimental models that recapitulate CRC patient-relevant aneuploidy patterns. Developing such models demands a clear understanding of how aneuploidy evolves during the progression from pre-malignant adenoma to carcinoma and how aneuploidy patterns vary across CRC subtypes. In this review, we highlight and discuss context-dependent alterations in the aneuploidy landscape of CRC, examining associations with tumor subtype, tumor stage, whole-genome doubling, TP53 status, and metastatic organotropism. Through a synthesis of the current literature and meta-analysis of publicly available bulk sequencing datasets of colorectal carcinomas and colorectal adenomas, this review provides a comprehensive CRC aneuploidy framework to guide future studies aimed at unraveling the mechanistic and clinical implications of these copy-number alterations.",

    "abstract": "Genotype-dependent regeneration efficiency remains a major obstacle in wheat transformation, limiting its use in elite but recalcitrant cultivars. To elucidate the molecular basis of regeneration divergence, we compare transcriptomic profiles, chromatin accessibility dynamics, and transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) between the regenerable variety Fielder and the recalcitrant variety JiMai22 (JM22). Fielder displays dynamic transcriptional reprogramming and chromatin remodeling between 3 and 6 days after induction, activating morphogenic regulators such as TaSCR, TaWOX5, and TaLBD17. In contrast, JM22 shows limited chromatin changes and transcriptional stagnation, primarily inducing stress-responsive pathways. TRN analysis reveals a more complex, regeneration-focused network in Fielder, enriched with AP2, Dof, and GRAS transcription factor families. Among these, TaSCR is identified as a key regulator. Functional assays demonstrate that the TaSCR-TaLBD17 regulatory cascade improves transformation efficiency across diverse wheat genotypes. These findings provide a molecular framework to overcome transformation barriers in recalcitrant cultivars.",

The simplicity of the cellular composition suggests that corneal afferents participate in tissue homeostasis by regulating immune cells. Transcriptomic analysis of retrogradely labeled corneal afferents in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) found that they express many immune-related genes. Optogenetic activation of corneal afferents increased neutrophils and monocytes in both the cornea and TG, as well as inducing phenotypic changes in natural killer (NK) cells. Unsupervised pathway analysis indicated neuronally expressed Ccl2 as a modulator of immune cell responses. Selective deletion of neuronal Ccl2 decreased the number of myeloid cells in the cornea and TG in response to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, resulting in compromised viral clearance during primary infection. These experiments demonstrate that corneal afferent activation is sufficient to trigger inflammatory responses that can assist the host in initiating anti-viral immunity.",

In the mammary gland, JAK2 and STAT5a/b are essential for alveolar cell differentiation and lactation, but little is known about the cooperative roles of JAKs and STATs before pregnancy. We examined female mice conditionally deficient in JAK1/2 and discovered that both kinases jointly regulate epithelial cell proliferation and ductal morphogenesis. To assess the role of downstream STATs, we generated genetic models co-deficient in STAT3/5a/5b with or without STAT1 or JAK1. Although loss of STAT3/5a/5b leads to a JAK1-dependent upregulation of STAT1, the formation of mammary ducts is unaffected by the lack of expression and activation of all seven STAT proteins. Additionally, STAT deficiency impairs the cytokine-induced autophosphorylation of JAK1/2. These findings suggest that mammary duct development is orchestrated by STAT-independent signaling mechanisms of JAK1 and JAK2, potentially beyond their roles as tyrosine kinases.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is driven by aberrant activation of oncogenic pathways, including AKT1, which requires mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser473. This study identifies PHLDB3 and Liprin-\u03b11 as key regulators of RICTOR-dependent, mTORC2-mediated AKT1 signaling, independently of p53. PHLDB3 interacts with RICTOR to enhance AKT1 phosphorylation and promote tumor progression. In p53-null CRC cells, PHLDB3 knockdown reduces AKT1 activation, whereas PHLDB3 overexpression increases it. Liprin-\u03b11 stabilizes PHLDB3 by limiting its proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining mTORC2 activity. Liprin-\u03b11 depletion lowers PHLDB3 levels and impairs AKT1 signaling, whereas Liprin-\u03b11 overexpression boosts PHLDB3-mediated AKT1 activation and CRC cell proliferation. Importantly, the Liprin-\u03b11-PHLDB3 axis depends on RICTOR, underscoring a hierarchical regulation essential for AKT1 activation. PHLDB3 is significantly overexpressed in CRC and is associated with poor prognosis. These findings reveal a Liprin-\u03b11-PHLDB3-mTORC2-AKT1 signaling pathway important for CRC growth and present this pathway as a promising therapeutic target in CRC.",

Although Lis1 has been reported to both inhibit and activate dynein, the molecular basis for these opposing effects remains unclear. We identify the COP9 signalosome (CSN) and protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) complexes as key determinants of Lis1-dependent dynein regulation. Lis1 recruits CSN to dynein, promoting deneddylation and maintaining the motor in an inactive state, thus functioning as an off switch. Neddylation of dynein intermediate chain 1 (DIC1) at K42 is required for the assembly of active transport complexes. In contrast, PRMT5 methylates Lis1 at R238, switching Lis1 to a positive regulator. This modification displaces CSN from dynein, restores neddylation, and promotes motor activation and cargo transport. These findings reveal a dual regulatory axis in which Lis1 integrates CSN- and PRMT5-dependent cues to switch dynein between inactive and active states, providing a mechanistic basis for Lis1's contrasting roles in dynein control.",
