### Cell Cycle
Direct cell cycle literature, including papers on DNA replication, mitosis
and papers that mention our major genes of interest: MASTL, Greatwall kinase, Cdk, Cycling, Wee1, Cdc25, PKMyt1, Plk1, Aurora, PP2A, PP1, PP4, B55, PPP2R2A, PPP2R2B, PPP2R2C, and PPP2R2D, HAPSTR1
This should also involve papers linking metabolism and cell cycle as well as papers on cell size control.

### Genome stability
papers on the DNA damage response, aneuploidy, polyploidy, micronuclei formation, chromatopyrosis

### Senescence
papers that describe senescence phenotypes and mechanisms of cell fate decisions involving senescence

### Cancer Biology
All other papers that involve cancer more broadly in relation to our areas of interest (exclude specialised clinical papers!)

### CRISPR/Cas9 and genome editing
Methods papers on new developments in the genome editing, gene targeting areas

### Imaging
Method papers on new imaging techniques, probes, software, hardware

### AI and Biology
Broadly papers of interest describing new AI approaches in our areas of interest

### Evolutionary Cell Biology
papers describing new insights into evolution of cellular traits

### Other
Any other topics you consider noteworthy but that don't fit into the previous categories.
